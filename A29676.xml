            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I have read of an Emperour, that delighted in no undertaking, ſo much as thoſe which in the eſteem
<pb facs="tcp:30758:3"/>of his Counſellors, and Captains were deemed moſt difficult and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, if they ſaid ſuch or ſuch an enterprize would never be accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, it was argument enough to him, to make the adventure, and he uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally proſpered, he ſeldom miſcarried</p>
            <p>I have never found greater and choycer bleſſings, to attend any of my poor weak Labours, than thoſe that have been brought forth into the world thorow the greateſt ſtraits and difficulties.</p>

               <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> reports that one telling a ſouldier,

            <p>I remember <hi>Auſtin</hi> beginneth one of his Sermons thus <hi>(Ad vos mihi Sermo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Auguſt. de tempore ſerm. 246</note> 
               <hi>O juvenes, flos aetatis, periculum mentis)</hi> To you is my ſpeech, O young men, the flower of age, the danger of the mind.</p>
            <p>So ſay I, to you O Young men, do I dedicate the enſuing Treaetiſe, and that firſt becauſe, the matter contained therein, doth primarily and eminently concern you.</p>
            <p>And Secondly, Becauſe of an earneſt deſire, that I have of your internal and eternal welfare.</p>
            <p>And Thirdly, Becauſe of ſome late impulſes that have been upon my ſpirit, to leave this Treatiſe in your hands as a Legacy of my Love, and as a teſtimony and witneſs of my (great) ambition to help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward your everlaſting ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:30758:4"/>
            <p>And Fourthly, Becauſe there is moſt hope of doing good amongſt you (as I evidence more at large in the following Treatiſe.)</p>
            <p>And fifthly; To countermine the great underminer of your ſouls, whoſe great deſign is to poyſon you, and poſſeſs you in the morning of your dayes.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, To provoke others that are more able and worthy; to bee more ſerviceable to you in declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, fully on this very ſubject, which none yet have done that I know of, though it be a point of as great concernment to young perſons (eſpecially) as any I know in all the ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, and Laſtly, becauſe there are very many that do lye in wait, to deceive, corrupt,
<note place="margin">Eph. 4 14 <hi>A</hi> blind eye is werſe then a lame foor, he that had the leproſy in his head was to be pronounced utterly unclean</note> and Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon young perſons with God-diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, Chriſt denying, conſcience waſting, and ſoul damning opinions, Principles, and Blaſphemies.</p>
            <p>I have read of one who boaſted, and gloried in this, that he had ſpent thirty years in corrupting and
<pb facs="tcp:30758:5"/>Poyſoning of youth; doubtleſſe many wretches, many monſters there be among us, who make it their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, their glory, their all, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude and draw young Perſons to thoſe dangerous errours and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, that leads to deſtruction. Error and folly (ſaith one very well) be the knots of Satan, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hee tyes children to the ſtake to be burnt in hell.</p>
            <p>There is a truth in what the <hi>Tragaedian</hi> ſaid long ſince <hi>(Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num in auro bibitur)</hi> Poyſon is commonly drunk out of a cup of gold; So is an error, or by-notion ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt taken into the judgement and conſcience from perſons of the faireſt carriage, &amp; ſmootheſt converſations. Error is ſo foul an Hagge, that if it ſhould come in its own ſhape; a man would loath it, and fly from it, as from hell.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Jezabel</hi> had not painted her face, ſhee had not gotten ſo many young doteing Adulterers to have followed her to their own ruine.</p>
            <p>Ah! Young men, young men,
<pb facs="tcp:30758:5"/>the bleſſing of the Lord upon your ſerious and diligent peruſal of this Treatiſe, may bee a happy means to preſerve you from being enſnared and deluded by thoſe monſters,
<note place="margin">Mar. 23.15</note> who compaſſe Sea and Land to make proſelytes for bell.</p>
            <p>And thus I have given you the reaſons of my dedicating this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe to the ſervice of your ſouls. I would willingly preſume that it will be as kindly taken; as it is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially tendred; I hope none of you into whoſe hands it may fall, will ſay as once <hi>Antipater</hi> King of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia</hi> did, when one preſented him with a book treating of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, his anſwer was <hi>(Ou Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo)</hi> I have no leiſure.</p>
            <p>Ah! Young men and women, young men and virgins, as you tender the everlaſting welfare of your ſouls, as you would eſcape hell, and come to heaven, as you would have an intereſt in Chriſt, a pardon in your boſomes, as you would be bleſſed here, &amp; glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hereafter, find time, find leaſure to read over and over the following treatiſe, which is purpoſely calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb facs="tcp:30758:6"/>for your eternal good. But before I go further, I think it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in ſome reſpects to give the world ſome further account of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſons or motives that hath prevailed with mee once more to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in print; and they are theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Having preached a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon occaſionally upon thoſe words (on which this following diſcourſe is built.) I was earneſtly importun'd to print the Sermon, by ſome wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy friends; I did as long as in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty I could withſt and their deſires (judging it not worthy of them) but being at laſt overcome, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting about the work, the breathings and comings in of God were ſuch, as hath occaſioned that one Sermon to multiply into many. <hi>Luther</hi> tells us, that when hee firſt began to turn his back upon Popery, hee intended no more, but to withſtand Popiſh pardons, and ſelling indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies; yet neither would God, or his enemies let him alone, till hee reſolved with <hi>Moſes</hi> not to leave a hoof of Popery unoppoſed,
<pb facs="tcp:30758:6"/>&amp;c. God many times in the things of the Goſpel, carries forth his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants beyond their intentions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their reſolutions. But</p>
            <p>Secondly, The kinde acceptance, and good quarter that my other peeces have found in the world, and thoſe ſignal and multiplyed bleſſings that have followed them, to the winning of many over to Chriſt, and to the building up of others in Chriſt, hath incouraged mee to preſent this Treatiſe to the World, hoping that the Lord hath a bleſſing in ſtore for this alſo. Gracious experiences are beyond notions, and impreſſions; they are very quickening, and encouraging.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That I might in ſome meaſure make up others neglects, whoſe age, whoſe parts, whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, whoſe graces, hath long called upon them to do ſomething conſiderable this way, and that they may bee provoked by my weak aſſay to do better, and to make up what is wanting, through my invincible infirmities, and
<pb facs="tcp:30758:7"/>ſpiritual wants and weakneſſes, which are ſo many, as may well make a ſufficient Apology for all the defects, and weakneſſes that in this Treatiſe ſhall appear to a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous judicious eye. But</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The love of Chriſt and ſouls hath conſtrained mee to it;
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.14. 2 Cor. 12.15. <hi>Solus amor neſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> difficultates.</hi> Love knows no difficulties.</note> as there is an attractive, ſo there is a compulſive vertue in divine love. Love to Chriſt and ſouls will make a man willing to ſpend, and bee ſpent; hee that praies himſelf to death, that preaches himſelf to death, that ſtudies himſelf to death, that ſweats himſelf to death, for the honour of Chriſt, and good of ſouls, ſhall bee no looſer in the end: divine love is like a rod of Myrtle, which as <hi>Pliny</hi> reports, makes the traveller that carries it in his hand, that hee ſhall never bee faint or weary. Divine love is very o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative <hi>(ſi non operatur, non eſt)</hi> if it do not work, it is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is not at all; divine love like fire is not idle, but active; hee that loves cannot bee barren; love
<pb facs="tcp:30758:7"/>will make the ſoul conſtant and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant in well doing. God ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits none to heaven (ſaith <hi>Juſtin</hi> Martyr) but ſuch as can perſwade him by their works, that they love him. The very heathen hath obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<note place="margin">Seneca.</note> that God doth not love his children with a weak womaniſh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but with a ſtrong maſculine love; and certainly they that love the Lord ſtrongly, that love him with a Maſculine love; they cannot but lay out their little all for him, and his glory. But</p>
            <p>Fifthly, I obſerve that Satan, and his inſtruments are exceeding buſy and unwearied in their deſigns, attempts, and indeavours, in theſe dayes, to corrupt and poyſon,
<note place="margin">It is ſaid of <hi>Marcellus</hi> the Roman Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral that he could not bee quiet <hi>(Nec victor, nec vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus)</hi> neither Conquered, nor Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; ſuch a one is Satan.</note> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file and deſtroy the young, the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the moſt hopeful, and moſt flouriſhing plants among us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Latimer</hi> told the Clergy in his time, that if they would not learn diligence, and vigilance of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, they ſhould learn it of the Devil, who goes up and down his Dioceſes, and acts by an
<pb facs="tcp:30758:8"/>untired Power, ſeeking whom hee may deſtroy, when the wolves are abroad, the Shepheard ſhould not ſleep but watch; yea double his watch, remembring that hee were better have all the bloud of all the men in the world upon him, than the bloud of one ſoul upon him; by his negligence or otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Satan is a Lyon, not a Lamb, a roaring Lyon, not a ſleepy Lyon, not a Lyon ſtanding ſtill, but a Lyon going up and down as not being contented with the Prey, the many millions of ſouls hee hath got, he ſeeks whom he may ſip up at a draught, as that word (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) in the <hi>1 Pet. 5.8.</hi> imports; his greateſt deſign, is to fill hell with ſouls, which ſhould awaken every one to bee active, and to do all that may bee done to prevent his deſign, and to help forward the ſalvation of ſouls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> compares good paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
<note place="margin">Chryſ. in Mat. Ho. 15.</note> to fountains that ever ſend forth waters, or Conduits that are alwayes running, though no pail bee put under. But</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:30758:8"/>
            <p>Sixthly, and Laſtly,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. ult.</note> I know the whole life of man is but an hour to work in, and the more work any man doth for Chriſt on earth, the better pay he ſhall have when hee comes to Heaven.
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 9.6</note> Every man ſhall at last reap as he ſows; Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of doing ſervice for Chriſt, and ſouls, are more worth than a world, therefore I was willing to takehold on this, not knowing how ſoon I may put off this earthly Tabernacle;
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.13, 14</note> and remembring that as there is no beleeving, nor repenting in the grave,
<note place="margin">Eccl. 9.10</note> So there is no praying, preaching, writing, nor Printing in the grave; we had need to be up and doing, to put both hands to it, and to do all wee do with all our might,
<note place="margin">John 9.4</note> knowing that the night draws on upon us, wherein no man can work.</p>
            <p>A Chriſtians dying day is the Lords pay day; that is a time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive wages, not to do work. And thus I have given the World a true account of the Reaſons that moved me to print the following diſcourſe; before I cloſe up, I deſire to ſpeak a
<pb facs="tcp:30758:9"/>word to young perſons, and another to aged perſons, and then I ſhall take leave of both.</p>
            <p>My requeſt to you, who are in the primeroſe of your dayes, is this, if ever the Lord ſhall be pleaſed ſo to own and Crown, ſo to bleſs, and follow this following diſcourſe; as to make it an effectuall means of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you to the Lord, of winning you to Chriſt, of changing your natures, and converting your ſouls (for ſuch a thing as that, I pray, hope, and beleeve) that then you would do two things for me,</p>
            <p>Firſt; That you would never ceaſe, bearing of me upon your hearts when you are in the mount, that I may bee very much under the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings out of the Spirit, that I may be clear, high, and full in my commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, and that I may bee alwayes cloſe, holy, humble, harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and blameleſſe in my walkings with God. And that his work may more and more proſper in my hand.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 66.16 1 Pet. 3.15</note> That you would by word of mouth, letter, or ſome other way,
<pb facs="tcp:30758:9"/>acquaint mee with what the Lord hath done for your ſouls; if he ſhall make mee a ſpiritual father to you, do not hide his grace from mee, but acquaint mee how hee hath made the ſeed that was ſown in weakneſs to riſe in power upon you, and that</p>
            <p>Firſt, That I may do what I can to help on that work begun upon you, that your penny may become a pound, your mite a million, your drop an ocean.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That I may the better Engliſh ſome impreſſions that have been upon my own ſpirit, ſince I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun this work.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 2 19, 20 2 Cor. 9.2</note> That my joy and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs may bee increaſed, and my ſoul more abundantly engaged to that God, who hath bleſt the day of ſmall things to you; ponder theſe ſcriptures, (<hi>2 Cor. 7.3, 4, 13. Phil. 2.2. ch. 4.1.</hi> Philemon <hi>ver. 7. 2 John 3.4.</hi>) And then be aſhamed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what the Lord hath done for you, if you can.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">Mat. 25.23 Dan. 12.3 Prov. 11.30</note> it is better to convert one, than to civilize a thouſand, and
<pb facs="tcp:30758:10"/>will turn more at laſt to a Miniſters account in that day, wherein he ſhall ſay, <hi>Loe here am I, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that thou haſt given mee, Iſa. 8.18.</hi> ſuch a man (with his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual children about him) ſhall look on God with more comfort and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than thoſe that are onely able to ſay, Loe here am I, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Benefices; here am I, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Eccleſiaſtical dignities, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; here am I, and the many hundreds a year, that man had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and I have gotten. But</p>
            <p>Fifthly,
<note place="margin">Act. 9.3 Iſa. 6.5 Mal. 2.5, 6, 7. &amp;c.</note> and Laſtly, The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of others is a ſecondary and more remote evidence of a mans own renovation and converſion. <hi>Paul</hi> was converted himſelf, before God made him inſtrumental for others Converſion. Gods uſuall method is, to convert by them, who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>
            <p>I do not remember any one inſtance in all the ſcripture, of Gods conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any by ſuch who have not been converted firſt themſelves; yet I know his grace is free, and the wind
<pb facs="tcp:30758:10"/>blows where it liſts, when it liſts, and as it liſts.</p>
            <p>To aged perſons I have a word, and then I have done.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To Gray-headed Saints, Ah Friends, ah Fathers, would you ſee your honour, your happineſs, your bleſſedneſs! then look into this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, and there you will finde what an unſpeakable honour it is to bee an Old diſciple, what a glory it is to be good betimes, and to continue ſo to Old age.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To white-headed Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, whoſe ſpring is paſt, whoſe ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is overpast, and who are arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the fall of the leaf, and yet have a hell to eſcape, a Chriſt to beleeve in, ſins to pardon, hearts to change, ſouls to ſave, and heaven to make ſure, would ſuch be incour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged from ſcripture grounds to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, beleeve, and hope; that yet there is mercy for ſuch, let them ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peruſe this Treatiſe, eſpecially the latter part of it, and there they may finde enough to keep them from deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing, and to incourage them to
<pb facs="tcp:30758:11"/>adventure their ſouls upon him that is mighty to ſave.</p>
            <p>There are many things in this Treatiſe that are of uſe to all, and ſeveral things of moment that are not every day Preach't nor read. I have made it as pleaſureable as time would permit, that ſo it might be the more profitable to the reader, and that I might the better take the young man by (a holy) craft;
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. ch. 15.2 Prov. 11.30</note> which is a high point of heavenly wiſdome; there being no wiſdome to that of winning of ſouls. I ſhall now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this poor peice with my weak prayers, that it may be ſobleſt from heaven, as that it may bring in ſome, and build up others, and do good to all, and ſo reſt</p>

               <p>The Hebrew word (Nagnar) tranſlated Child, verſ. 3. is very often applied to ſuch as wee call youth, or young men, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.5. <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.11. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.17. &amp;c. Of ſuch age and prudence, was <hi>Abijah,</hi> as that he could chuſe good and refuſe evill, hee was a <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom,</hi> hee was good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the bad, the bent and frame of his heart was towards that which was good, when the heart both of his Father and Mother
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:30758:17"/>was ſet upon evill. <hi>Abijah</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to bee good betimes; hee croſt that peſtilent proverb, a young Saint, and an old Devill. Tis the glory and goodneſs of God that hee will take notice of the leaſt good that is in any of his, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.6. There was but one good word in <hi>Sarahs</hi> ſpeech to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that was this, ſhee called him <hi>Lord,</hi> and this God mentions for her honour and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, <hi>ſhee called him Lord:</hi> God looks more upon one grain of Wheat, than upon a heap of Chaff; upon one ſhining Pearl than upon a heap of rubbiſh.

There's an elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the Originall. The pains of hell gat hold upon mee; So wee read, but the Hebrew is; The pains of hell found me (one word ſignifies both,) they found mee, I did not find them. <hi>There was found in Abijah ſome good thing towards the Lord, i.e.</hi> there was found in him without ſearching, or ſeeking, ſome good thing towards the Lord, it was plain and viſible enough, men might ſee and obſerve it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inquiring, or ſeeking, they might runne and read ſome good thing in him towards the Lord.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The word ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſignifies, Finding by ſeeking or enquiry, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.6. <hi>Seek yee the Lord while hee may bee found, &amp;c.</hi> So upon ſearch and enquiry there was found in <hi>Abijah</hi> (though young) ſome good thing toward the Lord.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:30758:19"/>
               <p>Thirdly, Sometimes the word notes the obtaining of that which is ſufficient, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 17.16. <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.22. <hi>Judg.</hi> 21.14. in <hi>Abijah</hi> there was that good in him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Lord, that was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to evidence the work of grace upon him, ſufficient to ſatisfy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and others of the goodneſs, and happineſſe of his condition; though hee died in the prime, and flower of his days, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Secondly, that which is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Houſes full of all good things, i. e.</hi> houſes full of all profitable things.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That which is pleaſing, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.27. <hi>Do what is good in thine eyes, i.e.</hi> do what is pleaſing in thine eyes.</p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:30758:20"/>
               <p>Fourthly, That which is full and compleat, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.15. <hi>Thou ſhalt bee buried in a good old age, i.e.</hi> thou ſhalt bee buried when thine age is full and compleat.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That which is joyfull and delightful, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.8. <hi>wee come in a good day, i. e.</hi> wee come in a joyful and delightfull day; now put all together and you may ſee that there was found in <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> when hee was young, that which was right and juſt, that which was pleaſing and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that which was matter of joy and delight.</p>
               <p>In the words you have two things that are moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That this young mans goodneſſe was towards the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> many there are that are good, nay, very good to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, who yet are bad, ya very bad towards God.
<note place="margin">This age af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords many ſuch hypocrites ſuch Monſters &amp;c.</note> Some there are who are very kind to the creature, and yet very unkind to their Creator, many mens good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30758:20"/>towards the creature is like the riſing Sun, but their goodneſs towards the Lord is like a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning cloud,
<note place="margin">Hoſ. 6.4.</note> or as the early dew which is ſoon dried up by the Sun-beams, but <hi>Abijahs</hi> good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was towards the Lord, his goodneſſe faced the Lord, it look't toward the glory of God. Two things makes a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, good actions, and good aimes; And though a good aim doth not make a bad action good,
<note place="margin">There may bee <hi>Malum opus in bona materia,</hi> as in <hi>Jehues</hi> zeal.</note> (as in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi>) yet a bad aime makes a good action bad (as in <hi>Jehu</hi>) whoſe juſtice was approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but his policy puniſhed, the firſt Chapter of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> and the fourth verſe, doubtleſs <hi>Abijahs</hi> actions were good, and his aims good; and this was indeed his glory, that his goodneſs was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Lord.</p>
               <p>Its recorded of the <hi>Catanenſes</hi> that they made a ſtately monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Kingly magnificence, in remembrance of two Sons who took their aged parents upon
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30758:21"/>their backs, and carried them through the fire, when their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe was al in a flame, theſe young men were good towards their Parents; but what is this to <hi>Abijahs goodneſſe towards the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. A man cannot bee good towards the Lord, but he will bee good towards others; but a man may be good towards others that is not good towards the Lord: Oh, that mens pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes did not give too loud a Teſtimony every day to this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion! &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Hee was good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the bad,
<note place="margin">Happy are thoſe ſouls that with the Stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or Crab-fiſh can ſwim againſt the ſtream of cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and that with <hi>Atticus</hi> can cleave to the right, though looſing ſide.</note> 
                  <hi>he was good in the houſe of Jeroboam,</hi> tis in faſhion to ſeem (at leaſt) to bee good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the good; but to bee real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good among thoſe that are bad, that are eminently bad, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues not onely a truth of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but a great degree of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; this young man was good <hi>in the houſe of Jeroboam, who made all Iſrael to ſin,</hi> who was naught, who was very naught,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:30758:21"/>who was ſtark naught; and yet <hi>Abijah,</hi> as the fiſhes which live in the ſalt Sea are freſh, ſo though hee lived in a (ſink) a ſea of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs; yet hee retained his <hi>goodneſſe towards the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ſay Roſes grows the ſweeter, when they are planted by Garlick, they are ſweet and rare Chriſtians indeed, who hold their goodneſs, and grow in goodneſſe where wickedneſs ſits on the throne, and ſuch a one the Young man in the text was.</p>
               <p>To bee Wheat among Tares, Corn among Chaffe, Pearls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Cockles, and Roſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Thorns, is excellent.</p>
               <p>To bee a <hi>Jonathan</hi> in <hi>Sauls</hi> Court, to be an <hi>Obadiah</hi> in <hi>Ahabs</hi> Court, to be an <hi>Abedmelech</hi> in <hi>Zedechias</hi> Court, and to bee an <hi>Abijah</hi> in <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Court, is a wonder, a miracle.</p>
               <p>To bee a <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodome,</hi> to bee an <hi>Abraham</hi> in <hi>Chaldaea,</hi> to bee a <hi>Daniel</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> to bee a <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> in <hi>Damaſco,</hi> and to bee a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:30758:22"/>
                  <hi>Job</hi> in the land of <hi>Huſſe,</hi> is to be a Saint among Devils, and ſuch a one the young man in the Text was.</p>
               <p>The Poets affirm that <hi>Venus</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appeared ſo beautious, as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhee ſate by black <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlcans</hi> ſide. Gracious ſouls ſhine moſt clear when they bee ſet by black con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioned perſons. <hi>Stephens</hi> face never ſhin'd ſo Angelically, ſo gloriouſly (in the Church) where all were vertuous, as before the Councill, where all were vitious and malicious. So <hi>Abijah</hi> was a bright Star, a ſhining Sun in <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Court, which for prophanneſs and wickedneſs, was a very hell.</p>
               <p>The words that I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to inſiſt upon will afford us ſeveral obſervations, but I ſhall onely name one, which I intend to proſecute at this time, and that is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>That tis a very deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and commendable thing for young men to bee really good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:30758:22"/>
               <p>Other Scriptures ſpeak out this to be a truth,
<note place="margin">Job 32.4, 5, 6, 7.</note> beſides what you have in the Text to confirm it, as that of the ſecond of <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles</hi> Chap. 34.1, 2, 3. verſes. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> was eight years old, when hee beganne to reign, and hee reigned in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> one and thirty years. And hee did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, and walked in the wayes of <hi>David</hi> his father, and declined neither to the right hand nor to the left; for in the eighth year of his reign, while hee was yet young, hee beganne to ſeek after the God of <hi>David</hi> his father: and in the twelfth year, he beganne to purge <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from the high places, and the Groves, and the carved Images, and the molten Images. Twas <hi>Obadiahs</hi> honor that hee feared the Lord from his youth.
<note place="margin">1 King. 18.12 2 Tim. 3.15</note> And <hi>Tymothys</hi> crown that he knew the Scripture from a child, and <hi>Johns</hi> joy,
<note place="margin">2 Epiſt. 4. v.</note> that hee found Children walking in the

               <p>The grounds and Reaſons of this point, <hi>viz. That it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſirable and commendable thing for young men to bee really good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times;</hi> are theſe that follow,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it; and divine commands are not to bee diſputed but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed,

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Remember now thy Creator,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to know him, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to love him, remember to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him, remember to delight in him, remember to depend upon him, remember to get an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in him, remember to live to him, and remember to walk with him. <hi>Remember now thy Creator,</hi> the Hebrew is <hi>Creatours,</hi> Father, Son, and Spirit. To the making of man, a Council was called in Heaven, in the 1. of <hi>Geneſis</hi> and 29 <hi>verſ. Remember thy Creatours,</hi> remember the Father, ſo as to know him, ſo as to bee inwardly acquainted with him. Remember the Son, ſo as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in him, ſo as to reſt upon
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:30758:24"/>him, ſo as to imbrace him, and ſo as to make a compleat reſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy ſelf to him. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Spirit, ſo as to hear his voice, ſo as to obey his voice, ſo as to feel his preſence, and ſo as to experience his influence, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Remember now thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth;</hi> hee doth not ſay in the time of thy youth, but <hi>in the dayes of thy youth,</hi> to note that our life is but as a few dayes; tis but a vapour, a ſpan, a flower, a ſhadow, a dream; and therefore <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith well, <hi>that though death bee before the old mans face, yet hee may bee as near the young mans back, &amp;c.</hi> Mans life is the ſhadow of ſmoak,
<note place="margin">Aug. l. 1. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſ.</note> the dream of a ſhadow, one doubteth whether to call it a dying life, or a living death; ah young men! God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands you to bee good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times. Remember young men that it is a dangerous thing to neglect one of his commands, who by another is able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:30758:24"/>you into nothing, or into Hell. To act or run croſſe to Gods expreſſe command (though under pretence of Revelation from God) is as much as a mans life is worth; as you may ſee in that ſad ſtory, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13. <hi>ch.</hi> 24. <hi>verſe,</hi> &amp;c. Let young men put all their carnal reaſons, though never ſo many, and weighty, into one ſcale, and Gods abſolute command in the other, and then write Tekel upon all their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; They are weighed in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, and found too light. Ah ſirs! what God commands muſt bee put in ſpeedy execution,
<note place="margin">Obedientia non diſcutis Dei mandata, ſed facit, Prosper.</note> without denying, or delaying, or diſputing the difficulties that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it. Moſt young men in theſe dayes do as the Heathens, when their gods called for a man, they offered a candle; or as <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> offered up a painted man in ſtead of a living. When God calls upon young men to ſerve him with the Primroſe of their youth; they uſually put him off
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:30758:25"/>till they are overtaken with trembling joynts, dazled eyes, fainting hearts, failing hands, and feeble knees; but this will bee bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe in the end, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Young men muſt bee really good betimes, becauſe they have means and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of being good betimes. Never had men better means, and greater opportunities of being good, of doing good, and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving good than now. Ah Lord! how knowing, how be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, how holy, how heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how humble might young men bee, were they not wanting to their own ſouls: Young men might bee good, very good, yea eminently good; would they but improve the means of grace, the tenders of mercy, and the knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt by his Word, Works, and Spirit.</p>
               <p>The Ancients painted Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity with a hairy forehead,
<note place="margin">Eraſmus.</note> but bald behinde, to ſignifie that while a man hath opportunity before
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30758:25"/>him, hee may lay hold on it, but if hee ſuffer it to ſlip away, hee cannot pull it back again.</p>
               <p>How many young men are now in everlaſting chains, who would give ten thouſand worlds (had they ſo many in their hands to give) to injoy but an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to hear one ſermon more, to make one prayer more, to keep one Sabbath more, but cannot? this is their hell, their torment, this is the Scorpion that is ſtill biting, this is the Worm that is alwayes gnawing. Wo, wo to us, that wee have neglected and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled away thoſe golden oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities that once wee had, to get our ſins pardoned, our natures changed, our hearts bettered, our conſciences purged, and our ſouls ſaved, &amp;c.
<note n="*" place="margin">Bellarm. In concione de cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciatibus Gehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae.</note> I have read of a King, who having no iſſue to ſucceed him, eſpying one day a well-favoured youth, took him to Court, and committed him to Tutors, to inſtruct him, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by his will, that if hee prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:30758:26"/>fit for government, hee ſhould bee crowned King, if not, hee ſhould bee bound in chains, and made a Gally-ſlave. Now when hee grew to years, the Kings exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors perceiving that hee had ſadly neglected thoſe means and opportunities, whereby hee might have been fit for State government, called him before them, and declared the Kings will and pleaſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, which was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly performed, for they cauſed him to bee fettered, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Gallies. Now what tongue can expreſſe how much hee was affected, and afflicted with his ſad and miſerable ſtate, eſpecially when hee conſidered with himſelf, that now hee is chained, who might have walked at liberty. Now hee is a ſlave, who might have been a King, now hee is over-ruled by Turks, who might once have ruled over Chriſtians; the application is eaſie.</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:30758:26"/>
               <p>Ah young men! young men,
<note place="margin">Tis ſtoried of Charles King of Sicily and Jeruſalem, that hee was called <hi>Carolus Cuncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi> Charles the lingerer; this age affords ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch linge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, &amp;c.</note> ſhall Satan take all opportunities to tempt you? ſhall the world take all opportunities to allure you? ſhall wicked men take all opportunities to enſnare you? and to undo you? and ſhall Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian friends take all opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to better you? and ſhall Gods faithful Meſſengers take all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to ſave you? and will you? <hi>will you neglect ſo great ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? Plutarch</hi> writes of <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi> that when hee could have taken <hi>Rome</hi> hee would not, and when hee would have taken <hi>Rome,</hi> hee could not. Many in their youthful dayes, when they might have mercy, Chriſt, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Heaven; they will not, and in old age, when they would have Chriſt, pardon, peace, Heaven, they cannot, they may not. God ſeems to ſay as <hi>Theſius</hi> ſaid once, go ſayes hee, and tell <hi>Creon, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> offers thee a gracious offer, yet I am pleaſed to bee friends, if thou wilt ſubmit (this is my firſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:30758:27"/>meſſage) but if this offer prevail not, look for mee to bee up in arms.</p>
               <p>The third Reaſon, <hi>why Young men ſhould bee really good betimes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lord, ſaith Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin, I have lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thee late; the greater was his ſins, and the more were his ſorrows.</note> is, becauſe then they will have fewer and leſſer ſins to anſwer for, and repent of, multitudes of ſins and ſorrows are prevented by <hi>being good betimes.</hi> The more wee number our dayes, the fewer ſins wee ſhall have to number. As a coppy is then ſafeſt from blotting, when duſt is put upon it, ſo are wee from ſinning, when (in the time of our youth) wee remember that wee are but duſt. The tears of young penitents do more ſcorch the Devils than all the flames of Hell, for hereby all their hopes are blaſted, and the great underminer counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and blown up. <hi>Mane</hi> is the Devils Verb, hee bids tarry, time enough to repent; but <hi>Mane</hi> is Gods Adverb, hee bids re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent early in the morning of thy youth; for then thy ſins will bee
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:30758:27"/>fewer, and leſſer. Well young men, remember this, hee that will not at the firſt hand buy good council cheap, ſhall at the ſecond hand buy repentance over dear.</p>
               <p>Ah young men! young men, if you do not begin to bee good betimes, thoſe ſins that are now as Jewels ſparkling in your eyes,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 25.7. Job 13.26.</note> will at laſt bee milſtones about your necks, to ſink you for ever. —Among many things that <hi>Beza</hi> in his laſt will and Teſtament, gave God thanks for, this was the firſt and chief, that hee at the age of ſixteen years, had called him to the knowledge of the truth, and ſo prevented many ſins and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows that otherwiſe would have overtaken him, and have made his life leſſe happy, and more miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Young Saints often prove old Angels,
<note place="margin">There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing puts a more ſerious frame into a mans ſpirit than to know the worth of his time.</note> but old ſinners ſeldome prove good Saints, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The fourth ground, <hi>why young men ſhould bee really good betimes,</hi> is this, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe time is a precious Talent that young men muſt be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:30758:28"/>countable for; the ſooner they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to bee good, the more eaſy will bee their accounts, eſpecially as to that great Talent of time. <hi>Cato</hi> and other heathens, held that account muſt bee given, not only of our labour, but alſo of our lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, at the great day it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that they that have ſpent their time in mourning, have done better than they that have ſpent their time in dancing; and they that have ſpent many dayes in humiliation, than they that have ſpent many dayes in idle recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>I have read of a devout man, who when hee heard a clock ſtrike, hee would ſay, here is one hour more paſt that I have to anſwer for. Ah young men! as time is very precious, ſo it is very ſhort, time is very ſwift, it is ſuddenly gone, in the 9. of <hi>Job</hi> and the 25. <hi>verſ. My dayes are ſwifter than a Poſt, they flee away, they ſee no good.</hi> The Hebrew word <hi>(Kalal)</hi> tranſlated <hi>ſwifter
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:30758:28"/>than a Poſt,</hi> ſignifies any thing that is light, becauſe light things are quick in motion.</p>
               <p>The Ancients emblem'd time with wings, as it were,
<note place="margin">Sophocles. Phocilides.</note> not run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but flying. Time is like the Sun, that never ſtands ſtill, but is ſtill a running her race; the Sun did once ſtand ſtill, yea went back, but ſo did never Time. Time is ſtill running, and flying; it is a bubble a ſhadow, a dream; can you ſeriouſly conſider of this young men, and not <hi>begin to bee good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times?</hi> ſurely you cannot. Sirs, if the whole earth whereupon wee tread were turned into a lump of gold, it were not able to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe one minute of time. Oh the regreetings of the damned, for miſ-ſpending precious time!
<note place="margin">Who is there among us that knows how to value time, and prize a day at a due rate. Sen.

               <p>
                  <hi>Seneca</hi> was wont to jeer the <hi>Jews</hi> for their ill husbandry, in that they loſt one day in ſeven; meaning their Sabbath; O that it were not too true of the moſt of profeſſors both young and old, that they looſe not onely one day in ſeven, but ſeveral days in ſeven.</p>

               <p>The fifth Reaſon, <hi>Why young men ſhould bee really good betimes,</hi> and that is, becauſe they will have the greater comfort and joy when they come to bee old,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Seneca</hi> (though a Heathen could ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve me, true joy is no light thing.</note> the 71 <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 5. 17, 18. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. <hi>Thou art my hope, O Lord God, thou art my truſt from my youth. O God, thou haſt taught

               <p>The Eleventh Reaſon, <hi>Why young perſons ſhould bee really good betimes,</hi> and that is, becauſe tis ten to one, nay, a hundred to ten if ever they are converted,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:30758:43"/>if they are not converted when they are young.</p>
               <p>God uſually begins with ſuch betimes,

               <p>The twelfth and laſt Reaſon, <hi>why young men ſhould bee really good betimes,</hi> and that is, becauſe elſe they will never attain to the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:30758:45"/>honour of being old diſciples. It is a very great honour to bee an old Diſciple. Now this honour none reach to, but ſuch as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted betimes, but ſuch as turn to the Lord in the ſpring, and morning of their youth.

<note place="margin">What more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous than <hi>(puer. contum annorum)</hi> a child of an hundred years old?</note> nor for an old man to bee a babe in grace. An A. B.

               <p>The Lord ſpeaks many a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret in the ears of aged Saints, of old Chriſtians, which young Chriſtians are not acquainted with, as that phraſe imports, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.27. <hi>Thou O Lord God of hoſt, hath revealed to thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi>

Some wonder how that word to the ear comes to bee left out in your books, in which indeed the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis lyes, wee will tell many things in an old friends ear, which wee will not acquaint young ones with. So doth God many times whiſper an old Diſciple in the ear, and acquaints him with
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:30758:48"/>ſuch things that hee hides from thoſe that are of younger years. And by this you may ſee what an honor it is to be an old Diſciple.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">Heb. 5.11, 12, 13, 14. Yet as <hi>Solon</hi> was not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſay, that in his old age he was a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſo thoſe that are the greateſt Artiſts in Chriſtianity will confeſſe, that they are ſtill but lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> An old Diſciple, an old Chriſtian, hee hath got the art of ſerving God, the art of Religion, Got the art of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the art of praying, the art of meditating, the art of repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the art of beleeving, the art of denying his natural ſelf, his ſinful ſelf, his Religious ſelf. All Trades have their myſtery and difficulty; ſo hath the trade of Chriſtianity; young Chriſtians uſually bungle in religious work, but old Chriſtians acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves like workmen that need not bee aſhamed. A Young Carpenter gives more blows, and makes more chips, but an old Artiſt doth the moſt, and beſt work; a young Chriſtian may make moſt noiſe in religious duties, but an old Chriſtian makes the beſt work. A young Muſitian may play more quick
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:30758:48"/>and nimble, upon an inſtrument than an old, but an old Muſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an hath more skill and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than a young, the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is eaſy; And by this you may alſo ſee, what an honour it is, to be an old Chriſtian, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, An old Diſciple, an old Chriſtian, is rich in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual experiences,
<note place="margin">1 John 2.13</note> O the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences that hee hath of the ways of God, of the workings of God, of the word of God, of the love of God.
<note place="margin">Pſ. 119.49, 50. Old men love to ſpeak of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieet things.</note> O the divine ſtories that old Chriſtians can tell of the power of the Word, of the ſweetneſs of the Word, of the uſe-fulneſs of the Word, as a light to lead the ſoul, as a ſtaffe to ſupport the ſoul, as a ſpur to quicken the ſoul, as an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor to ſtay the ſoul, and as a cordial to comfort and ſtrengthen the ſoul! O the ſtories that he can tell you concerning the love of Chriſt, the bloud of Chriſt, the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſt, the merits of Chriſt, the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, the

O the ſtories that an old Diſciple can tell you of the indwellings of the ſpirit, of the operations of the ſpirit, of the teachings of the ſpirit, of the leadings of the ſpirit, of the ſealings of the ſpirit, of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſings of the ſpirit, and of the comforts and joyes of the ſpirit. O the ſtories that an old Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an can tell you, of the evil of Sinne, the bitterneſs of Sinne, the deceitfulneſs of Sinne, the prevalency of Sin, and the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of conqueſt over Sinne. O the ſtories that hee can tell you of the ſnares of Satan, the devices of Satan, the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Satan, the rage of Satan, the malice of Satan, the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Satan, and the wayes of triumphing over Satan. As an old Souldier can tell you of many battels, many ſcarres, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wounds, many loſſes, and many victories, even to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; So an old Saint is able
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:30758:49"/>to tell you many divine ſtories even to admiration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pliny</hi> writes of the Crocodile, that ſhee grows to her laſt day. So aged Saints,
<note place="margin">Hoſ. 14.5, 6, 7</note> they grow rich in ſpirituall experiences to the laſt. An old Chriſtian being once asked, if he grew in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Anſwered yea, doubtleſs I do, for God hath ſaid,

It is a brave ſight to ſee ancient Chriſtians like the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond-Tree. Now the Almond-tree doth flouriſh, and is full of bloſſomes in the winter of old age, for as <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond-Tree doth bloſſome in the month of <hi>January;</hi> experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in religion are beyond notions, and impreſſions; a ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified heart, is better than a ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tongue, no man ſo rich, ſo honourable, ſo happy, as the old Diſciple, that is rich in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall experiences, and yet there is no Chriſtian ſo rich in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences but hee would be rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
<note place="margin">The Lawyer.</note> As <hi>Julianius</hi> ſaid, that when hee had one foot in the grave, hee would have the other in the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:30758:50"/>School. So though an old Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple hath one foot in the grave, yet hee will have the other in Chriſts School, that he may ſtill bee treaſuring up more and more divine experiments; and by this alſo you ſee, <hi>what an honour it is to bee an old Diſciple, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, An old Diſciple is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtout, couragious, firm, and fixt in his reſolutions;
<note place="margin">Pſa. 44.9.—ult.</note> an old Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is like a pillar, a rock, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can move him, nothing can ſhake him, what is ſuckt in in youth, will abide in old age; old ſouldiers are ſtout and couragious, nothing can daunt nor diſcourage them. When <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> was an hundred and ten years old,
<note place="margin">Joſh. 24.15.29</note> O how couragious and reſolute was hee! <hi>And if it ſeem evil unto you, to ſerve the Lord, chuſe you this day whom you will ſerve, whether the Gods that your Fathers ſerved, that were on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the flood, or the gods of the</hi> Amorites, <hi>in whoſe land yee dwell; but as for mee and my houſe,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:30758:51"/>wee will ſerve the Lord. And it came to paſſe, after theſe things, that</hi> Joſhua <hi>the Son of</hi> Nun, <hi>the ſervant of the Lord dyed, being an hundred and ten years old. Confidius</hi> a Senator of <hi>Rome</hi> told <hi>Caeſar</hi> boldly that the Senators durſt not come to council for fear of his ſouldiers; hee replyed, why then doſt thou go to the Senate? hee anſwered, becauſe my age takes away my fear. Ah! none ſo couragious, none ſo divinely fearleſſe, none ſo careleſſe in evil dayes as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Chriſtians. An old Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian knows, that that good will do him no good, which is not made good by perſeverance; his reſolution is like that of <hi>Gonſalvo,</hi> who proteſted to his ſouldiers, ſhewing them <hi>Naples,</hi> that hee had rather die one foot forwards, than to have his life ſecured for long by one foot of retreat. Shall ſuch a man as I am flee, ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted <hi>Nehemia?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Neh. 6.11.</note> he will coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly venture life and limb, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than by one foot of retreat,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:30758:51"/>credit profeſſion with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of fearfulneſs.
<note place="margin">Ariſtotle, (though a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then) could ſay that in ſome caſes a man had better loſe his life, than bee cowardly. Ariſt. Ethie. 3. cap. 1.</note> It was a brave magnanimous ſpeech of <hi>Luther,</hi> when dangers from op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers did threaten him, and his aſſociates; come (ſaith hee) let us ſing the forty ſixth <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and then let them do their worſt. When <hi>Polycarpus</hi> was fourſcore and ſix years old, hee ſuffered Martyrdome couragiouſly, reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, and undauntedly.</p>
               <p>When one of the ancient Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs was very much threatned by his perſecutors, hee reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there is nothing of things viſible, nothing of things invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that I fear; I will ſtand to my profeſſion of the name of Chriſt, and contend earneſtly for the Faith once delivered to the Saints, come on it what will. Old Diſciples, old Souldiers of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 23.11, 12.</note> they have the heart and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of <hi>Shammah,</hi> one of <hi>Davids</hi> worthies, who ſtood and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the field, when all the reſt fled. The Hebrews call a young man
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:30758:52"/>
                  <hi>Nagnar,</hi> which ſprings from a root that ſignifies to ſhake off,
<note place="margin">Mat. 19.20.21, 22.</note> or to bee toſſed to and fro, to note how fickle, and how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in inconſtancy young men are, they uſually are perſons either of no reſolution for good, or of weak reſolution; they are too often wonn with a Nut, and loſt with an Apple: but now aged Chriſtians in all Earthquakes, they ſtand faſt, like <hi>Mount-Zion,</hi> that cannot bee removed. And by this alſo you may ſee, <hi>what an honour it is, to bee an old Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> an old Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, An old Diſciple, an old Chriſtian, is prepared for death, hee hath been long a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſin,
<note place="margin">Rom. 6 6. Gal. 5.24. ch. 6.14.</note> to the world, to friends, to ſelf, to relations, all, and no man ſo prepared to dye, as he that thus daily dyes. An old Diſciple hath lived ſincerely to Chriſt, hee hath lived eminently to Chriſt, hee hath lived in all conditions,
<note place="margin">Rom. 14.7, 8. Phil. 1.21, 22, 23.</note> and under all changes to Chriſt, he hath lived exemplarily to Chriſt,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:30758:52"/>hee hath lived long to Chriſt, and therefore the more prepared to dye, and bee with Chriſt. An old Diſciple hath a crown in his eye, a pardon in his boſome, and a Chriſt in his arms, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may ſweetly ſing it out with old <hi>Simeon, Lord, now let thy ſervant depart in peace.</hi> As <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary</hi> ſaid to his ſoul, ſoul, thou haſt ſerved Chriſt this ſeventy years,
<note place="margin">Zeno a wiſe heathen ſaid, I have no fear but of old age.</note> and art thou afraid of death? go out ſoul, go out. Many a day ſaid old <hi>Cowper</hi> have I ſought death with tears, not out of impatience, diſtruſt, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation, but becauſe I am wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſin, and fearful to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> calls upon the King of terrors, devour mee, devoure mee. And <hi>Auſtin,</hi> when old, could ſay, ſhall I dye ever?
<note place="margin">Cyprian could receive the cruelleſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death, with <hi>a Deo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tias.</hi> God I thank thee.</note> yes, or ſhall I die at all? yes, why then Lord if ever, why not now? why not now? ſo when <hi>Modeſtus</hi> the Emperors Lieutenant threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to kill <hi>Bazil,</hi> he anſwered, if that be all. I fear not; yea, your
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:30758:53"/>Maſter cannot more pleaſure mee, than in ſending mee unto my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, to whom I now live, and to whom I deſire to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten. I cannot ſay as hee (ſaid old Mr. <hi>Stephen Martial</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before his death) I have not ſo lived, that I ſhould now bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to dye, but this I can ſay, I have ſo learned Chriſt, that I am not afraid to dy. Old Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have made no more to dye, than to dine.
<note place="margin">Iſa. 57.1, 2</note> It is nothing to dye when the Comforter ſtands by; Old Diſciples know that to dye is but to lye down in their beds, they know that their dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day is better than their birth day,
<note place="margin">Eccl. 7.1</note> and this made <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> to prefer his Coffin before his Crown, the day of his diſſolution, before the day of his coronation. The Ancients were wont to call the dayes of their death, <hi>Natalia,</hi> not dying days, but birth days.</p>
               <p>The Jews to this day ſtick-not to call their <hi>Golgotha's Batte Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im,</hi> the houſes or places of the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:30758:53"/>Living; old Chriſtians know that death is but an entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life, tis but a paſſeover, a jubile, tis but the Lords Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-uſher to conduct them to heaven, and this prepares them to dye and makes death more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable than life, and by this you may ſee, <hi>that it is an honour to bee an old Diſciple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, An Old Diſciple, an old Chriſtian,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15 <hi>ult.</hi> 2 Cor. 9.6 Mat. 5.10, 11, 12 God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum laborem,</hi> according to their labour, though not <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum proven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> according to the ſucceſſe of their labour.</note> ſhall have a great reward in heaven, Old Chriſtians have done much, and ſuffered much for Chriſt, and the more any man doth, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers for Chriſt here, the more glory hee ſhall have hereafter. Twas the ſaying of an old Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple upon his dying bed, hee is come, hee is come (meaning the Lord) with a great reward for a little work. <hi>Agrippa</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuffered impriſonment for wiſhing <hi>Cajus</hi> Emperor, the firſt thing <hi>Cajus</hi> did when hee came to the Empire, was to prefer <hi>Agrippa</hi> to a Kingdome;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:30758:54"/>hee gave him alſo a chain of Gold as heavy as the chain of Iron that was upon him in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; And will not Chriſt richly reward all his ſuffering Saints? Surely hee will, Chriſt will at laſt pay a Chriſtian for every prayer hee hath made, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sermon hee hath heard, for every tear hee hath ſhed, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very morſell hee hath given, for every burden hee hath born, for every battel hee hath fought, for every enemy hee hath flain, and for every temptation that he hath overcome. <hi>Cyrus</hi> in a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition againſt his enemies, the better to incourage his ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to fight, in an oration that he made at the head of his Army, promiſed upon the victory, to make every foot ſouldier an horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and every horſeman a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, and that no Officer that did valiantly, ſhould be unrewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<note place="margin">Mat. 19.28 Luke 22.30. Mat. 5.12</note> but what are <hi>Cyrus</hi> his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to the rewards that Chriſt our General promiſes to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:30758:54"/>his, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21. <hi>To him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth, will I grant to ſit with me in my throne, even as I alſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, and am ſet down with my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his throne.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">As the King in <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaid of a groat, it is no kingly gift, and of a Talent, it is no baſe bribe.</note> As there is no Lord to Chriſt, ſo there is no rewards to Chriſts, his rewards are the greateſt rewards, hee gives Kingdomes, Crowns, Thrones, hee gives grace and glory, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. It is ſaid of <hi>Araunah</hi> that noble <hi>Jebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite,</hi> renowned for his bounty, that he had but a ſubjects purſe, but a Kings heart, but Jeſus Chriſt hath a Kings purſe, as well as a Kings heart, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly hee gives.</p>
               <p>And as Chriſts rewards are the greateſt rewards, ſo his rewards are the ſureſt rewards; he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that hath promiſed, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Antiochus</hi> promiſed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but ſeldome gave (upon which hee was called in way of deriſion a great promiſer) but Jeſus Chriſt never made any promiſe, but hee hath or will
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:30758:55"/>perform it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. nay he is often better than his word, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. hee gives many times more than wee ask. The ſick man of the Palſy asked but health,
<note place="margin">Mat. 9.2</note> and Chriſt gave him health and a pardon to boot. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> deſired but wiſdome,
<note place="margin">2 Chron. 1.10.11, 12, 13, 14, 15.</note> and the Lord gave him wiſdome, and honour, and riches, and the favour of creatures, as paper and pack-thred into the bargain. <hi>Jacob</hi> asked him but cloaths to wear,
<note place="margin">Gen. 28.20. Compared with Gen. 32.10.</note> and bread to eat, and the Lord gave him theſe things, and riches, and other mercies into the bargain. Chriſt doth not meaſure his gifts by our Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but by his own riches, and mercies. Gracious ſouls many times receive many gifts, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours from God, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dreamt off, nor durſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to begge, which others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreamly ſtrive after, and go without. <hi>Archelaus</hi> being much importuned by a covetous cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier for a cup of gold, wherein

               <p>The fourth motive to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke young ones to be really good betimes, is, to conſider that the preſent time, the preſent day is the onely ſeaſon that you are ſure of, time paſt cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, and time to come cannot be aſcertained.

               <p>Ah! Young men, young men,

<note place="margin">Often conſider what the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned would give (were it in their hands) for one ſeaſon of grace, for one opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of mercy.</note> do not neglect the preſent day, there is no time yours, but the preſent time; no day yours but the preſent day; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not pleaſe your ſelves, and feed your ſelves with hopes of time to come, and that you will repent but not yet; and lay hold on mercy, but not yet; and give up your ſelves to the Lord next week, next mouth, or next year; for that God that hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed you mercy, and favour, upon the day of your return, he hath not promiſed to prolong your lives till that day comes, when a Souldier was brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Lamacus</hi> a Commander, for a miſ-behaviour, and pleaded he would do ſo no more, <hi>Lamacus</hi> anſwered (<hi>non licet in bello his pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care</hi>) no man muſt offend twice in War; So God (eſpecially in theſe Goſpel days, wherein the motions of Divine juſtice are more ſmart and quick, than in former days) happily will not

               <p>Ah young men! young men, you ſay you will bee good to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Lord before you die, but if you are not good to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Lord to day, you may dye to morrow; nay juſtice may leave him to bee his own exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner to morrow, who will not repent, nor ſeek the Lord to day. <hi>Otho</hi> the Emperor ſlew himſelf with his own hands, but ſlept ſo ſoundly the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

               <p>Young men, I will ſuppoſe you to be good accountants; now if you pleaſe to count the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and mark the age of the Sacrifices in the old Teſtament, you ſhall finde more Kids and Lambs offered than Goats, and old Sheep; You have no leaſe of your lives, you are not ſure that you ſhall live to <hi>Iſaacks</hi> age,

<note place="margin">Job 36.14.</note> You read of them who die in their youth, and whoſe lives are among the unclean. Slip not the preſent ſeaſon, neglect not this day of grace; let not Satan keep your ſouls and Chriſt any longer aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by telling of you,
<note place="margin">As out of the boughs of a tree are taken wedges to cleave it in peeces; ſo out of our own luſts Satan works Engines to deſtroy us.</note> that you are too young; that hereafter will bee time enough. <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells us, that by this very temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation the Devil kept him off from receiving of Chriſt, from cloſing with Chriſt Seven years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: hee could no ſooner think of inquiring after Chriſt, of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an intereſt in Chriſt, of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving off his ſinful courſes, &amp;c. but Satan would bee ſtill a ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting, thou art too young to leave thy drunkenneſs, thou art too young to leave thy Dalilahs, to leave thy Harlots; till at laſt hee cryed out, how long ſhall I ſay it is too ſoon? why may I not repent to day? and lay hold
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:30758:81"/>on Jeſus Chriſt to day? &amp;c. Ah young men! this is your day, this is your ſeaſon, if you will not now hearken and obey, you may periſh for ever. <hi>Caeſar</hi> had a letter given him by <hi>Artemido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> that morning hee went to the Senate, wherein notice was given him of all the conſpiracy of his murtherers; ſo that with eaſe, hee might have prevented his death; but neglecting the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, was ſlain; hee ſlipt his ſeaſon, and dyes for it. Ah! how many for ſliping gracious ſeaſons and opportunities have died for ever? Soul-opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are more worth than a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand worlds; mercy is in them, grace and glory is in them, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and eternity is in them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, To provoke you to bee good betimes, conſider, how juſt it is with God to reſerve the dregs of his wrath for them, who reſerve the dregs of their dayes for him: how can a husband embrace that wife in her old age,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:30758:81"/>who hath ſpent all the time of her youth, in following after ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers? Will any man receive ſuch into his ſervice, who hath all their dayes ſerved his enemies? and received ſuch wounds, blows, and bruſes, that renders them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for his ſervice?</p>
               <p>Ah young men! young men,

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Multa ſenem circumveniunt incommoda.</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratius. Many are the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences that do encompaſs an old man.</note> for old, lame, and ſick Sacrifices rarely reach as high as Heaven. Is not old age very unteachable; in old age are not men very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt to take in, and as unapt to give out? In old age (oftentimes) men are men, and no men, they have eyes, but ſee not, ears, but hear not, tongues, but ſpeak not, feet, but walk not. An aged man is but a moving Anatomy, or a living Mortuary; now how unlovely, how uncomely, how unworthy, nay, how incenſing,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:30758:82"/>how provoking a thing muſt this needs bee,
<note place="margin">The reproach of the evil of wickedneſſe is not to bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to old age <hi>(Solet enim ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nectus eſſe defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis, infirma, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livioſa, edeutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, lueroſa, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docilis, &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſta)</hi> ſaith Plutarch, in Apothegm. Rom. For old age uſeth to be deformed, weak, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, toothleſſe, covetous, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teachable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet.</note> when men will dally with God, and put him off till their doting dayes have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken them; till their ſpring is paſt, their Summer overpaſt, and they arrived at the fall of the leaf, yea till winter colour have ſtained their heads with gray and hoary hairs. How provoking this is, you may ſee in thoſe ſad words of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Jer. 22.21, 22. <hi>I ſpake unto thee in thy proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but thou ſaid'ſt, I will not hear; this hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyeſt not my voice:</hi> But will God put up this at their hands? no, therefore it follows in the next verſe, <hi>Surely thou ſhalt bee aſhamed and confounded for all thy wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh that young men would let this Scripture lye warm every morning upon their hearts, that ſo they may not dare to put off God, and provoke him to their own confuſion; though you are
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:30758:82"/>young and in your ſtrength, yet, are you ſtronger than God; can you make your party good with him? if you will needs bee a provoking, provoke them that are your matches, and do not contend with him that is mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than you, that can command you into nothing, or into Hell at pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, conſider, that the ſooner you are good on earth, the greater will bee your reward in Heaven; the ſooner you are gracious,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 58.11. Gen. 15.1. Pſal. 19.11.</note> the more at laſt you will bee glorious; you read in the Scripture of a reward, of a great reward,
<note place="margin">Matth. 5.12. Heb. 10.35. John 2.8.</note> and of a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; now <hi>thoſe that are good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,</hi> that know, ſeek, ſerve, and love the Lord in the ſpring, and morning of their youth, they are in the faireſt way of gaining the greateſt, and the fulleſt reward.</p>
               <p>And this I ſhall make clear by that which follows.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The ſooner any man begins to bee really good, the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:30758:83"/>more good hee will do in this world. Now the more good any man doth on earth, the more glory hee ſhall have in Heaven. Therefore my beloved Brethren,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.58.</note> 
                  <hi>bee yee ſtedfaſt, unmoveable, alwaies abounding in the work of the Lord, foraſmuch as you know, that your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is not in vain in the Lord.</hi> Mans wages, mans reward ſhall bee according to his works; hee that doth moſt work here, ſhall have moſt reward hereafter. God will at laſt proportion the one to the other,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 9.6.</note> the reward to the work. <hi>Hee which ſoweth ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, ſhall reap ſparingly, and hee which ſoweth bountifully, ſhall reap bountifully.</hi> Though no man ſhall bee rewarded for his works; yet God will at laſt meaſure out happineſſe, and bleſſedneſſe to his people,
<note place="margin">Rom. 2.5, 6, 7.</note> according to their ſervice, faithfulneſſe, diligence, and work in this world. Grace is glory in the bud, and glory is grace at the full; glory is nothing elſe but a bright conſtellation of graces,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:30758:83"/>happineſſe, nothing but the quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence of holineſſe. Grace and glory differ <hi>(non ſpecie, ſed gradu)</hi> in degree, not kind, as the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpeak. Grace and glory dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer very little, the one is the ſeed, the other is the flower; grace is glory militant, and glory is grace triumphant; and a man may as well plead for equal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of grace in this world, as hee may plead for equal degrees of glory in the other world. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the more grace here, the more glory hereafter; and the more work Chriſtians do on earth, the more glory they ſhall have in Heaven; and the ſooner men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to bee good, the more good they will do in this world, and the more they do here, the more they ſhall have hereafter. Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers ſeem to weigh our ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues with our vices, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the preponderation of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, denominate us good, or bad, and ſo deliver us up to reward or puniſhment.</p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:30758:84"/>
               <p>No man can commend good works magnificently enough, (ſaith <hi>Luther</hi>) for one work of a Chriſtian is more precious than Heaven and Earth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the world cannot ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently reward one good work. And in another place ſaith the ſame Author, If I might have my deſire, I would rather chuſe the meaneſt work of a Country Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian (or poor maid) than all the victories and triumphs of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the great, and of <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And again, whatſoever the Saints do, though never ſo ſmall and mean, it is great and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, becauſe they do all in faith, and by the word, ſaith the ſame Author. To prevent miſtakes you muſt remember that the works that Jeſus Chriſt will reward at laſt, are ſupernatural works; they are 1 Works of God, 2 Wrought from God, 3 For God, 4 In God, 5 According to God; they are works that flow from ſupernatural principles; and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:30758:84"/>they are directed to ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ends, and performed in a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural way; now the ſooner a man begins to bee good, the more hee will abound in theſe good works, and the more doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs any man abounds in ſuch good works on earth; the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reward hee ſhall have in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; yet it muſt not bee forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that the beſt actions; the beſt works of Hypocrites, and all men out of Chriſt, are but <hi>(ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dida peccata)</hi> fair and ſhining ſins, beautiful abominations. And as the <hi>Phenix</hi> in <hi>Arabia</hi> gathers ſweet odoriferous ſticks together, and then blows them with her wings,
<note place="margin">David made uſe of his bow, but did not truſt to his bow. The Dove made uſe of her wings, but did not truſt in her wings, but in the Ark.</note> and burns her ſelf with them; ſo many a carnal profeſſor, burns himſelf with his own good works, that is, by his expecting and truſting to receive that by his works, that is only to bee received and expected from Jeſus Chriſt. Though all that man can do to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the meriting of Heaven, is no more than the lifting up
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:30758:85"/>of a feſtraw towards the meriting of a Kingdome; yet ſuch a proud peece man is, that hee is ready e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſay with proud <hi>Vega (Coelum gratis non accipiam)</hi> I wil not have Heaven of free coſt.
<note place="margin">Merces non eſt debita, ſed gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuita.</note> A proud heart would fain have that of debt, which is meerly of grace, and deſires that to bee of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, which God hath intended to bee of free mercy; which made one to lay, that hee would ſwim through a Sea of Brimſtome, that hee might come to Heaven at laſt; but hee that ſwims not thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through the Sea of Chriſts blood, ſhall never come there; man muſt ſwim thither, not through brimſtone, but through blood, or hee miſcarries for ever.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Again, the ſooner a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to bee good, the more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable hee will bee to others, and the more hee will provoke others to good; now all the good that you provoke others to, by counſel, or carriage, ſhall bee
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:30758:85"/>put down to your account (as all the ſins that men provoke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to, is put down to their accounts:

               <p>Ah!

               <p>Ah! how kindly, how ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did the Lord take this at their hands, that they followed him in their youth, while their bones were full of marrow, while they were ſtrong and fit for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, while nature was freſh, live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vigorous: In the Law God called for the firſt of all things;
<note place="margin">Exod. 23.19</note> hee required not only the firſt fruits, but the very firſt of the firſt; The firſt of the firſt-fruits of thy land, <hi>thou ſhalt bring into the houſe of the Lord thy God.</hi> God is the firſt being, the firſt good, and therefore deſerves the firſt of the firſt; and the beſt of the beſt;

               <p>As many young women, and ſickly children cannot ſtay till the fruit be ripe, but muſt have it while it is green, even ſo ſaith God, my heart, my deſires, are ſo vehemently ſet upon the firſt fruits, the firſt things, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtay, I cannot ſatisfie my ſelf without them, and what would God teach us by all this, but to ſerve him with the firſt-fruits of our age, the prim-roſe of our child-hood, the morning of our youth.

               <p>The eighth Motive or Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to provoke you to bee good betimes, to ſeek and ſerve
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:30758:88"/>the Lord in the morning of your youth, is,
<note place="margin">Early Converts will never have cauſe to ſay, as that deſpairing Pope ſaid, the Croſs could do him no good, becauſe he had ſo often ſold it away.</note> to conſider that this may bee a ſpecial means to prevent many black temptations, and an encouragement to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand all temptations that you may meet with from a tempting Devil, and a tempting World; an early turning to the Lord will prevent many temptations to deſpair, many temptations to neglect the means openly, to deſpiſe the means ſecretly: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny temptations about the being of God, the goodneſſe, faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, truth, and juſtice of God; temptations to deſpair, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to lay violent hands on a mans ſelf: temptations to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion all that God hath ſaid, and that Chriſt hath ſuffered, ariſes many times from mens delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and putting off of God to the laſt, all which, with many others; are prevented by a mans ſeeking and ſerving of the Lord in the ſpring and morning of his youth.

               <p>The ninth Motive or Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to ſtir up young men to be good betimes, to ſeek and ſerve the Lord in the ſpring and morning of their youth, is, to conſider the worth and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of ſouls.</p>

               <p>Ah young men! young men, that the ſerious thoughts of this great day, might put you upon breaking off the ſins of your youth; and the dedicating of your ſelves to the knowledge, love, and ſervice of the Lord, in

               <p>The firſt is drawn from Chriſts judicial proceedings in the laſt day, ſet down largely and clearly in the 25 of <hi>Matthew,</hi> where hee inumerateth only the good works they had done, but takes no notice of the ſpots and blots,
<note place="margin">Deut. 3.2, 4, 5, 6</note> of the ſtaines and blemiſhes, of the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and innormities, of the weakneſſes and wickedneſſes of his people. My</p>
               <p>Second Reaſon is taken from Chriſts vehement proteſtations that they ſhall not come into

                  <hi>John</hi> 5.24. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, he that heareth my Word, and beleeveth on him that ſent mee, hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: but is paſſed from death unto life.</hi> Thoſe words ſhall not come into condemnation, are not rightly tranſlated, the Original is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> ſhall not come into judgement, not into damnation, as you read it in all your Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh books, I will not ſay what ſhould put men upon this expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition rather than a true Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Original word: further, it is very obſervable, that no Evangeliſt uſeth this double aſſeveration but <hi>John,</hi> and hee never uſeth it but in matters of greateſt weight and importance,
<note place="margin">John 1.51. ch. 3.3.11. ch. 6.20.32.47.53. &amp;c.</note> and to ſhew the earneſtneſs of his ſpirit, and to ſtirre us up to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter attention, and to put the thing aſſerted out of all queſtion, and beyond all contradiction; as when wee would put a thing for ever out of all queſtion, wee do
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:30758:98"/>it by a double aſſeveration, verily verily, tis ſo, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe his not bringing their ſinnes into judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doth moſt and beſt agree with many precious and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous expreſſions that wee finde ſcattered (as ſo many ſhining ſparkling Pearls) up and down in Scripture, as</p>
               <p>Firſt, With thoſe of Gods blotting out the ſinnes of his People,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 43.25</note> I even I am hee that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for my own ſake,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 44.22</note> and will not remember thy ſinnes. <hi>I have blotted out as a thick cloud, thy tranſgreſſions, and as a cloud thy ſins.</hi> Who is this that blots out tranſgreſſions? hee that hath the keyes of heaven and hell, at his Girdle, that opens and no man ſhuts, that ſhuts and no man opens, he that hath the Power of life and death, of condemning and abſolving, of killing and of making alive, hee it is that blots out tranſgreſſions; if an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:30758:99"/>officer, ſhould blot out an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditement, that perhaps might do a man no good, a man might for all that bee at laſt caſt by the Judge; but when the Judge or King ſhall blot out the indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with their own hand, then the indictment cannot return, now this is every beleevers caſe, and happineſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to thoſe glorious expreſſions, of Gods not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of their ſinnes any more, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.25. <hi>And I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy ſins; And they ſhall teach no more every man his neighbour,</hi>

<note place="margin">Heb. 8.12</note> 
                  <hi>for I will bee merciful to their unrighteouſneſſe, and their ſinnes, and their iniquities will I remember no more.</hi> And again the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>This is the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant

                  <hi>I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them: and their ſinnes and iniquities will I remember no more.</hi> The meaning is, their iniquities ſhall quite bee forgotten, I will never mention them more, I will never take notice of them more, they ſhall never hear more of them from mee, though God hath an iron memory to remember the ſinnes of the wicked, yet he hath no memory to remember the ſins of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, His not bringing their ſinnes into judgement, doth moſt and beſt agree with thoſe bleſſed expreſſions, of his caſting their ſinnes into the depth of the Sea, and of his caſting them behind his back.
<note place="margin">Mich. 7.19</note> 
                  <hi>Hee will turn again, hee will have compaſſion upon us, hee will ſubdue our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and thou wilt caſt all their ſinnes into the depths of the Sea,</hi>

               <p>By the Metaphor in the Text, the Lord would have us to know, that ſinnes pardoned ſhall riſe no more, they ſhall never be ſeen more, they ſhall never come on the account more, hee will ſo drown their ſinnes, that they ſhall never come up before him the ſecond time; And ſo much that other Scripture imports.
<note place="margin">Iſa. 38.17</note> 
                  <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold for peace I had great bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but thou haſt in love to my ſoul delivered it from the pit of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption;

The Father ſoon forgets, and caſts behinde his back thoſe faults that the child remembers, and hath alwaies in his eyes; ſo doth the Father of ſpirits.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, His not bringing their ſins into judgement, doth beſt agree with that ſweet, and choice expreſſion of Gods par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning the ſins of his people; <hi>And I will cleanſe them from all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 33.8.</note> 
                  <hi>whereby they have ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt mee; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have ſinned, and whereby they have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed againſt mee.</hi> So <hi>Micha.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:30758:101"/>Who is a God like unto thee that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth iniquity, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſion of the remnant of his heritage</hi> (as though hee would not ſee it,

                  <hi>ſaith the Lord, the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall bee ſought for, and there ſhall bee none; and the ſins of</hi> Judah, <hi>and they ſhall not bee found, for I will pardon them whom I reſerve;</hi> and thoſe words, and <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth by,</hi> in the (aforecited) ſeventh of <hi>Micha,</hi>

                     </gap>
                  </note> and the 18. according to the Hebrew <hi>(Vegnober Gnal)</hi> is,
<note place="margin">Gnabar hee paſſed over.</note> and <hi>paſſeth over; God paſſeth over the tranſgreſſion of his heritage;</hi> that is, hee takes no notice of it, as a man in a deep muſe, or as one that hath haſte of buſineſſe, ſeeth
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:30758:101"/>not things before him, his mind being buſied about other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, hee neglects all to minde his buſineſſe. As <hi>David,</hi> when hee ſaw in <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> the feature of his friend <hi>Jonathan,</hi> took no notice of his lameneſſe, or any other defect, or deformity. So God beholding in his people the glorious image of his Son, winks at all their faults and deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which made <hi>Luther</hi> ſay, <hi>do with mee what thou wilt, ſince thou haſt pardoned my ſin;</hi> and what is it to pardon ſin,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 40.1, 2.</note> but not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſin.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, in his not bringing their ſins into the Judgement of diſcuſſion, and diſcovery, doth beſt agree to thoſe expreſſions of forgiving, and covering, <hi>Bleſſed is hee whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven, whoſe ſin is covered.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 32.1.</note> In the original it is in the plural. Bleſſedneſſes, loe, here is a plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of bleſſings, a chain of pearls.</p>
               <p>The like expreſſion you have in the 85. <hi>Pſalm</hi> and the 2. <hi>verſ.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:30758:102"/>Thou haſt forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou haſt covered all their ſin. Selah.</hi> For the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of theſe Scriptures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; take notice that to cover, is a Metaphorical expreſſion; cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is ſuch an action,
<note place="margin">Sic velantur, ut in judicio non revelentur.</note> which is oppoſed to diſcloſure; to bee co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, is to bee ſo hid and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as not to appear. Some make the Metaphor from filthy loathſome objects, which are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from our eyes, as dead carkaſſes are buried under the ground; ſome from garments, that are put upon us to cover our nakedneſs, others from the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians that were drowned in the red Sea, and ſo covered with water; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from a great gulf in the earth, that is filled up and covered with earth, injected into it: And others make it in the laſt place an alluſive expreſſion to the Mercy-ſeat, over which was a covering, now all theſe Metaphors in the general tend to ſhew this, that the Lord will not look, he will not ſee,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:30758:102"/>hee will not take notice of the ſins hee hath pardoned, to call them any more to a judicial ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>As when a Prince reads over many treaſons, and rebellions, and meets with ſuch and ſuch which he hath pardoned, he reads on, he paſſeth by, hee takes no notice of them, the pardoned perſon ſhall never hear more of them, hee will never call him to account for thoſe ſins more. So here, &amp;c. When <hi>Caeſar</hi> was painted, hee put his finger upon his ſcar, his wart. God puts his fingers upon all his peoples ſcars, and warts, upon all their weakneſſes, and infirmities that nothing can bee ſeen but what is fair and lovely; <hi>Thou art all fair, my Love, and there is no ſpot in thee,</hi> Can. 4.7.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, it beſt agrees to that expreſſion of not imputing of ſin.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 32.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile.</hi> So the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6, 7, 8. now
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:30758:103"/>not to impute iniquity, is not to charge iniquity, not to ſet iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon his ſcore, who is bleſſed and pardoned, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Seventhly and laſtly, it beſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with that expreſſion that you have in the 103. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> and the 11, and 12. <hi>verſ. For as the Heaven is high above the Earth, ſo great is his mercy towards them that fear him: As far as the Eaſt is from the Weſt; ſo far hath hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved our tranſgreſsions from us.</hi> What a vaſt diſtance is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Eaſt and the Weſt? of all viſible latitudes, this is the greateſt; and thus much for the third Argument. The</p>
               <p>Fourth Argument, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails with mee to judge that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt will not bring the ſins of the Saints into the judgement of diſcuſſion, and diſcovery in the great day, is, becauſe it ſeems unſutable to three conſiderable things, for Jeſus Chriſt to proclaim the infirmities, and miſcarriages of his people to all the world.</p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:30758:103"/>
               <p>Firſt, It ſeems to bee unſutable to the glory and ſolemnity of that day, which to the Saints will bee a day of refreſhing, a day of reſtitution, a day of redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a day of coronation, as hath been already proved; now how ſutable to this great day of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, the proclamation of the Saints ſins will be, I leave the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to judge.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It ſeems unſutable to all thoſe near and dear relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that Jeſus Chriſt ſtands in towards his,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 9 6. Heb. 2.11, 12 Epheſ. 1.21, 22, Rev. 19.7. John 15.1. John 2.1, 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </note> hee ſtands in there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a Father, a Brother, a head, a Husband, a Friend, an Advocate; now are not all theſe by the law of relations bound ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to hide and keep ſecret (at leaſt from the world) the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and infirmities of their near and dear relations, and is not Chriſt? is not Chriſt much more? by how much hee is more a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a Brother, a Head, a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, &amp;c. in a ſpiritual way than any others can bee in a natural way, &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:30758:104"/>
               <p>Thirdly; It ſeems very unſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to what the Lord Jeſus requires of his in this world, the Lord requires that his people ſhould caſt a mantle of love, of wiſdome, of ſilence, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſie over one anothers weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and infirmities.
<note place="margin">Prov. 10.12. 1 Pet. 4.8.</note> Hatred ſtirreth up ſtrifes; but love cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all ſins; loves mantle is very large; love will finde a hand, a plaiſter to clap upon every ſore. <hi>Flavius Veſpaſianus</hi> (the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour) was very ready to conceal his friends vices, and as ready to reveal their vertues: So is divine love in the hearts of the Saints. <hi>If thy Brother offend thee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 18.15.</note> 
                  <hi>go and tell him his fault between him and thee alone; if he ſhall hear thee, thou haſt gained thy Brother.</hi> As the Pills of reprehenſion are to bee gilded and ſugred over with much gentleneſſe, and ſoftneſſe; ſo they are to bee given in ſecret, tell him between him and thee alone. Tale-bearers, and Tale-hearers are alike abominable,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:30758:104"/>Heaven is too hot, and too holy a place for them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.3. now will Jeſus Chriſt have us carry it thus towards offending Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and will hee himſelf act otherwiſe? nay, is it an evil in us to lay open the weakneſſes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of the Saints to the world? and will it bee an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, a glory, a vertue in Chriſt, to do it in the great day? &amp;c.</p>
               <p>A fifth Argument is this, it is the glory of a man to paſſe over a tranſgreſſion.
<note place="margin">Prov. 19.11.</note> 
                  <hi>The diſcretion of a man deferreth his anger, and it is his glory to paſſe over a tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi> or to paſſe by it,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Non amo quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam niſi offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> ſaid a Heathen.</note> as wee do by perſons or things, wee know not, or would take no notice of. Now <hi>is it the glory of a man to paſſe over a tranſgreſſion,</hi> and will it not much more bee the glory of Chriſt, ſilently to paſſe over the tranſgreſſions of his people, in that great day? The greater the treaſons and rebellions are that a Prince paſſes over, and takes no notice of, the more is it his
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:30758:105"/>honour, and glory; and ſo doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it will be Chriſts in that great day. To paſs over all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and rebellions of his people, to take no notice of them, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get them, as well as forgive them.</p>
               <p>The Heathens have long ſince obſerved, that in nothing man came nearer to the glory and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of God himſelf, than in goodneſs and clemency. Surely if it bee ſuch an honour to man, <hi>to paſſe over a tranſgreſſion,</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee a diſhonour to Chriſt, to paſs over the tranſgreſſions of his people, hee having already buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in the Sea of his blood. Again ſaith <hi>Solomon, It is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God to conceal a thing.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 25.2.</note> And why it ſhould not make for the glory of divine love to conceal the ſins of the Saints, in that great day, I know not: and whether the concealing the ſins of the Saints in that great day, will not make moſt for their joy, and wicked mens ſorrow, for their comfort
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:30758:105"/>and wicked mens terrour and torment. I will leave you to judge, and time and experience to decide; And thus much for the reſolution of that great queſtion. Having done with the Motives that may incourage and provoke young men to bee good betimes, to know, love, ſeek, and ſerve the Lord in the ſpring and morning of their dayes.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now come to thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections and helps, that muſt (by aſſiſtance from Heaven) bee put in practice, if ever you would bee good betimes, and ſerve the Lord in the Prim-roſe of your dayes. Now all that I ſhall ſay, will fall under theſe two heads. Firſt, Some things you muſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and warily decline, and arm your ſelves againſt; and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there are other things that you muſt proſecute and follow. Firſt; there are ſome things that you muſt warily decline, and they are theſe,</p>
               <p>Firſt, If ever you would bee
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:30758:106"/>good betimes, if you would bee gracious in the ſpring and morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your youth, Oh then take heed of putting the day of death far from you.
<note place="margin">Amos 6.3.</note> Young men are very prone to look upon death afar off, to put it at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from them, they are apt to ſay to death,
<note place="margin">Exod. 10.28.</note> as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaid to <hi>Moſes, Get thee from mee, and let mee ſee thy face no more;</hi> if old men diſcourſe to them of death, they are ready to anſwer as the High-Prieſt did <hi>Judas</hi> (in a different caſe) <hi>what is that to us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 27.4.</note> 
                  <hi>look you unto it?</hi> wee know ſickneſſe will come, and death is a debt that wee muſt all pay, but ſurely theſe gueſts are a great way from us, for doth not <hi>David</hi> ſay,

                  <hi>The daies of a man are threeſcore years and ten?</hi> wee have calculated our nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and wee cannot abate a day, a minute, a moment of <hi>threeſcore and ten;</hi> and therefore it is even a death to us to think of death, there being ſo great a diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our birth-day, and our
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:30758:106"/>dying-day, as wee have caſt up the account.</p>
               <p>Ah young men! it is ſad, it is very ſay, when you are ſo wittily wicked, as to ſay with thoſe in <hi>Ezekiel, Behold they of the houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſay,</hi>

               <p>Flatterers are the very worſt of ſinners. The Flatterers told <hi>Caeſar</hi> that his freckles in his face, were like the ſtarres in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, they bought and ſold <hi>Aurelius</hi> the Emperour at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And <hi>Auguſtus</hi> complained when <hi>Varrus</hi> was dead, that hee had none now left that would deal plainly and faithfully with him.</p>
               <p>So men may gain by Flattery they will bee like <hi>Harpaelus,</hi> who ſaid <hi>(Quod Regi placet, mihi placet)</hi> that which pleaſeth the King, pleaſeth mee,</p>
               <p>When <hi>Aſtyages</hi> ſet his own Sonne before him to feed upon him; O but let every young man ſay, (into whoſe hands this treatiſe ſhall fall) <hi>Quod Deo
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:30758:115"/>placet mihi placet</hi>) that which pleaſeth God pleaſeth mee. I have been the longer upon this out of love to young mens ſouls,
<note place="margin">Whileſt an Aſſe is ſtroaked under the belly you may lay on his back what burden you pleaſe.</note> who are ſo apt to bee inſnared in the Flatterers net, if ever you would bee good in good earneſt, you muſt abhor Flatterers as the firſt born of the Devil, and as ſuch that are moſt pernitious to mens happineſſe both here and hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>It is reported of one <hi>Oramazes</hi> that hee had an enchanted Egg, in which (as hee boaſted himſelf) hee had incloſed all the happineſs of the World, but being broken, nothing was found in it but Wind. Flatterers are the greateſt cheaters, the greateſt deceivers, in the world.</p>
               <p>They ſay of the <hi>Crocodile,</hi> that when hee hath killed a man, he will weep over him, as if hee were ſorry; and did repent for what he had done, the Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is eaſy.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, If you would bee good betimes, if you would ſeek and ſerve the Lord in the ſpring and morning of your dayes, then take heed of engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed affections to the things of the World.

Though the Load-ſtone cannot draw the Iron when the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond is in preſence, yet earthly poſſeſſions did draw this young mans ſoul away, when Chriſt the Pearl of price was preſent, the World is a ſilken net, and this young man found it ſo; the world is like Golden fetters, and this young man found it ſo; the world is like ſweet poyſon, and this young man found it ſo;
<note place="margin">They are <hi>dulce venenum,</hi> a ſweet poyſon. <hi>Bern.</hi>

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:30758:116"/>grace, or glory. Some ſay that when the Serpent <hi>Scytale</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not overtake the flying Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, ſhee doth with her beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful colours ſo aſtoniſh and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze them, that they have no power to paſs away, till ſhe have ſtung them; ſuch a Serpent the World proved to the young man in the Goſpel, it did ſo affect him and take him, ſo amaze him, and amuze him, that hee could not ſtir till it ſtung him to death. When the Moon is fulleſt it is furtheſt from the Sun, ſo the more men have of the World, the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (commonly) they are from God, and this the young man in the Goſpel made good.</p>
               <p>Many have ventured life and limb,

               <p>The whole world is circular,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:30758:117"/>the heart of man is triangular, and wee know a circle cannot fill a triangle; yea if it be not fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the three perſons in Trinity, it will bee filled with the world, the Fleſh, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.

               <p>Ah! Young men, young men, have none of you found it ſo?</p>
               <p>The World in all its bravery is no better than the Cities which <hi>Solomon</hi> gave to <hi>Hiram,</hi>

               <p>Fifthly, if you would be good betimes if you would know, ſeek, and ſerve the Lord in the ſpring and morning of your youth; then take heed betimes of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reaſon,
<note place="margin">Gal. 1.15, 16.</note> take heed of conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with fleſh and blood; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a hopeful young man hath been undone temporally, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done eternally by hearkening to thoſe evil counſellors.
<note place="margin">Cicero a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then could ſay, that man would not bee ſo wicked, and do ſo wickedly, were it not for his reaſon.</note>
               </p>

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:30758:119"/>enmity can never bee reconciled. Carnal Reaſon is not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, but it is utterly averſe to all goodneſſe; it builds ſtrong holds and ſyllogiſms againſt the moſt glorious Goſpel-truths, and accounts the precious things of Chriſt as a ſtrange thing; carnal Reaſon will make God and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel do homage to it; when car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reaſon is in the Throne, Chriſt and his truths muſt all bow, or bee judged before its bar.</p>
               <p>Ah young men, young men! as ever you would bee good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, ſtop your ears againſt all carnal Reaſonings within you; carnal Reaſon judges the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt things of the Goſpel to bee meer fooliſhneſſe;

               <p>It is ſafer and better for you to imitate thoſe young men, who in the morning of their daies have graciouſly, wiſely, and reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withſtood thoſe evil Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors; carnal Reaſon, fleſh and blood; <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Moſes, Daniel,</hi>

               <p>Another famous example you have in the ſtory of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, when <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> came to him, and were very earneſt to have him give way

               <p>Fourthly and laſtly, If you would bee good betimes, then you muſt acquaint your ſelves with thoſe that are good betimes; if you would bee gracious in the ſpring and morning of your youth, then you muſt begin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to bee much in with them, who are much in with Chriſt, who lye near his heart, and knows much of his mind:

<note place="margin">Pſal. 58.4 Joh. 3.20, 21</note> he is a ſafe priſoner to Satan, and a ſure enemy to good.</p>

               <p>Well Young men! There is a day a comming, wherein a good Conſcience will bee bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a good purſe, for then the Judge will not bee put off with a ſuit of Complements, or fair words, nor drawn aſide with hope of reward; and therefore as you would be able to hold up your heads in that day, make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of hearkning to the voice of Conſcience in this your day.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, if you would be good betimes, then you muſt know be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, wherein true happineſſe lyes; for a man will never begin to bee good, till hee begins to underſtand wherein his happineſs conſiſts.</p>
               <p>The Philoſophers ſpeaking of happineſs,

<note place="margin">Iſa. 56.12 Job 28.14</note> others look for it in the Creatures, but they muſt all ſay it is not in us, <hi>(Nil dat quod non habet)</hi> nothing can give what it hath not, if the Conduit Pipe hath no water, it can give no water; if a man hath no money, he can give no mony; if the Creatures have no happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they can give no happineſs; Now this jewel, this pearl, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, is not to bee found in the breaſt, in the boſome of creatures, in a word, becauſe I muſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten to a cloſe, mans happineſs lys,</p>

               <p>Laſtly, If you would be good betimes, then you muſt break your covenant with ſin betimes, you muſt fall out with your luſts betimes; you muſt arme and fence your ſelves againſt Sin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times;
<note place="margin">Iſa. 28, 15.18</note> a man never beginnes to fall in with Chriſt, till hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnes to fall out with his Sins, till ſin and the ſoul bee two, Chriſt and the ſoul cannot be one; Now to work your hearts to this, you ſhould alwayes look upon ſin under theſe notions:</p>
               <p>Firſt, If you would have the league diſſolved betwixt ſin and your ſouls betimes, then look upon ſin under the notion of an enemy betimes.</p>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:30758:156"/>
               <p>Dearly beloved,

               <p>Ah! how did his luſts warre both againſt body and ſoul.</p>
               <p>The Old man is like a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous friend, and a friendly Traitour; though it be a harder

               <p>Ah Young men! Can you look upon Sin under the notion of an enemy, and not break with it, and not arm againſt it?</p>
               <p>Well, remember this, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and ſweetneſs that follows victory over ſin, is a thouſand times beyond that ſeeming ſweetneſſe that is in ſin, and as victory over ſin is the ſweeteſt victory, ſo it is the greateſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, there is no conqueſt to that which is gotten over a mans own corruptions. <hi>Hee that is ſlow to
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:30758:158"/>anger, is better than the mighty, and hee that ruleth his ſpirit, than hee that taketh a City.</hi> It is noble to overcome an enemy without, but it is more noble to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome an enemy within; it is honourable to overcome fiery flames, but it is far more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to overcome fiery luſts.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was upon his dying-bed, among all his victories only one comforted him,
<note place="margin">Rom. 7.22, 23 2 Cor. 10.3, 4, 5, 6. Gal. 5.17.</note> and that was victory over his worſt enemy, <hi>viz.</hi> his own naughty heart.</p>
               <p>Ah young men, young men! your worſt enemies are within you, and all their plots, deſigns, and aſſaults are upon your ſouls, your moſt noble part; they know if that fort Royal bee won, all is their own, and you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, and ſhall bee their ſlaves for ever; and therefore it ſtands you upon, to arm your ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe inbred enemies, and if you ingage Chriſt in the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, you will carry the day, and
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:30758:158"/>when you ſhall lye upon your dying-beds, you will then finde that there is no comfort to that, which ariſeth from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of your own hearts, your own luſts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If you would break covenant with ſin, if you would arme and fence your ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin betimes,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.6. Gal. 3.10. Joh. 8.34.</note> then look upon ſin as the ſouls bonds, for as bonds tie things together, ſo doth ſin tie the ſinner, and the curſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it bindes the ſinner and wrath together, it links the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and hell together. I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and in the bond of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; iniquity is a chain, a bond; now bonds and chains gall the body, and ſo do ſin the ſoul, and as poor captives are held faſt in their chains, ſo are ſinners in their ſins; they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem themſelves by price,
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. uit.</note> nor by power.</p>
               <p>Ah young men, young men! no bondage to ſoul-bondage, no
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:30758:159"/>ſlavery to ſoul-ſlavery; the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> bondage under <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and the Chriſtians bondage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Turks,</hi>

               <p>Ah friends! You ſhould never look upon your ſins, but you ſhould look upon them as your bonds; yea as the worſt bonds that ever were; all other chains are golden chains, chains of Pearl, compared to thoſe chains of Iron and Braſſe; thoſe chains of luſts with which you are bound. Ah! who can thus look upon his chains, his ſins, and not loathe them, and not labour for freedome from them? <hi>Juſtinus</hi> the Emperours Motto was (<hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert as res ineſtimabilis</hi>) liberty is unvaluable; if civil liberty bee, ſurely ſpiritual liberty is much more; if you ask ſouls that were once in a ſtate of bondage, but

               <p>Thirdly, If you would break league with ſin, and arm and fence your ſelves againſt it, then look alwayes upon ſin under the notion of fire.
<note place="margin">Jude 23. <hi>Arpazontes</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a violent ſnatching, as the tender-hearted Mother to ſave the life of her child pulls it haſtily, and with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence out of the fire.</note> And others ſave with fear, pulling them out of the fire.

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:30758:160"/>goods, the treaſure, the ſervant, the child, the wife, the body, but this fire burns the ſoul, it deſtroies and conſumes that noble part, which is more worth than all the treaſures of a thouſand worlds; every man hath a hand, and a heart to quench the fire which burns his neighbours houſe, but few men have either hands or hearts to quench the fire that burns their neighbors ſouls, this is, and this ſhall bee for a lamentation.

               <p>I have read of one, who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the violence of any tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſin, would lay his hand on burning coals, and being not able to abide it, would ſay to himſelf, Oh how unable ſhall I be to indure the pains of hell? and this reſtrained him from evil; but what is the fire of hell, to the fire of ſin; now to provoke you to look upon ſin under the notion of fire, conſider with mee the ſundry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances between material, &amp; immaterial fire, between corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral common fire, and between this ſpiritual fire. Sin, As</p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:30758:160"/>
               <p>Firſt, Fire is terrible and dreadful; a ſhip on fire, a houſe on fire, Oh how dreadful is it! ſo ſin ſet home upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is exceeding terrible and dreadful. <hi>Mine iniquity</hi> (ſo the Hebrew) <hi>is greater than I can bear;</hi> ſin or iniquity is often put for the puniſhment of ſin, by a Metonymie of the efficient for the effect;
<note place="margin">Gen. 4.13. <hi>Mentiris Cain,</hi> thou lyeſt <hi>Cain,</hi> ſaith one on the Text.</note> for ſin is the natural Parent of puniſhment. <hi>Mine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> ſaith <hi>Cain, is ſo great, and lies ſo heavy, ſo terrible and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful upon my conſcience, that it cannot bee forgiven;</hi> and thus by his diffidence, hee ſtabs two at once, the mercy of God, and his own ſoul. So <hi>Judas,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 27.3, 4, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in that I have betrayed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood,</hi> and hee went and hanged himſelf. As there is no fighting with a mighty fire, ſo there is no bearing up, when God ſets home ſin upon the conſcience; a man will then chuſe ſtrangling, or hanging, rather than living under ſuch wounds and laſhes of
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:30758:161"/>conſcience. Hiſtories abounds with inſtances of this nature, but I muſt haſten to a cloſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Fire is moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and pernicious when it breaks forth of the chimny, or of the houſe, ſo it is with ſin. Sin is bad in the eye,
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.</note> worſe in the tongue, worſer in the heart, but worſt of all in the life. Fire, when out of its proper place, may do much hurt in the houſe, but when it flames abroad, then it doth moſt miſchief to others; Sin in the heart may undo a man, but ſin in the life may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do others, as well as a mans ſelf. Set a guard upon thy eye,
<note place="margin">Job. 31.1. Prov. 4.23. Epheſ. 5.15.</note> a greater upon thy heart, but the greateſt of all upon thy life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salvian</hi> relates how the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then did reproach ſome Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Salvianus de</hi> G. D. l. 4.</note> who by their lewd lives made the Goſpel of Chriſt to be a reproach; where (ſaid they) is that good Law which they do beleeve? where are thoſe rules
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:30758:161"/>of godlineſſe which they do learn? they read the holy Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and yet are unclean; they hear the Apoſtles writings, and yet are drunk, they follow Chriſt, and yet diſobey Chriſt, they profeſſe a holy Law, and yet do lead impure lives.</p>
               <p>But the lives of other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have been ſo holy, that the very Heathens obſerving them have ſaid, ſurely this is a good God, whoſe ſervants are ſo good. It is brave when the life of a Chriſtian is a commentary up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſts life. One ſpeaking of the Scripture,
<note place="margin">Auguſtin.</note> ſaith <hi>(verba viven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, non legenda)</hi> they are words to bee lived, and practiſed, not read only.
<note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> A Heathen adviſeth us to demean our ſelves, ſo cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly, as if our enemies did alwaies behold us. And ſaith another, for ſhame,
<note place="margin">Epictetus.</note> either live as Stoicks, or leave off the name of ſtoicks. Sirs, live as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, or lye down the name of Chriſtians.</p>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:30758:162"/>
               <p>Thirdly, Fire hardens, it makes the weak and limber clay to become ſtiff and ſtrong for the Potters uſe. So ſin hardens, it hardens the heart againſt the commands of God, the calls of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Jer. 5.3. ch. 19. ult. Iſa. 9.13.</note> and the wreſtlings of the Spirit. As you ſee in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the <hi>Jews,</hi> and moſt that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſound of the Goſpel. Ah! how many hath this fire (ſin) hardened in theſe daies, by working them to ſlight ſoul-ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening means,
<note place="margin">Jer. 2.25. ch. 18.12.</note> and by drawing them to entertain hardening-thoughts of God, and to fall in with ſoul-hardening company, and ſoul-hardening Principles, and ſoul-hardening examples, of hardened and unſenſible ſinners; one long ſince thus complained that they did (<hi>patientius ferre Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti jacturam, quam ſuam</hi>) more calmly paſſe by the injuries done to Chriſt, than thoſe which are done unto themſelves; this age is full of ſuch hardened unſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſouls.</p>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:30758:162"/>
               <p>Fourthly, Fire is a lively active element, ſo is ſin.
<note place="margin">Gen. 22. Pſal. 51. Job 3. Mat. 26. Rom. 1.15, &amp;c.</note> Ah how lively and active was this fire in <hi>Abraham, David, Job, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Paul,</hi> and other Saints? though Chriſt by his death hath given it its mortal wound, yet it lives, and is, and will be active in the deareſt Saints. Though ſin and grace were not born together, neither ſhall they dye together; yet while beleevers live in this world, they muſt live together. There is a Hiſtory that ſpeaks of a Fig-tree that grew in a ſtone wall, and all means was uſed to kill it, they cut off the branches, and it grew again, they cut down the body, and it grew again,
<note place="margin">Iſedore the Monk was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much out, who vaunted that hee had felt in himſelf no motion to ſin forty years together.</note> they cut it up by the root, and ſtill it lived, and grew untill they pulled down the ſtone-wall; till death ſhall pull down our ſtone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walls; Sin will live, this fire will burn.</p>
               <p>Wee may ſay of ſin, as ſome ſay of Cats, that they have many lives; kill them and they will
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:30758:163"/>live again, kill them again, and they will live again; ſo kill ſin once, and it will live again, kill it again, and it will live again, &amp;c. Sin oftentimes is like that Monſter <hi>Hydra</hi> cut off one head, and many will riſe up in its room.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Fire is of a penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nature,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 1.5, 6. Rom. 7.13.17. Sin is (<hi>malum Catholicum</hi>) A Catholick e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil (<hi>Quodcun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que in peccato, peccatum eſt</hi>) whatſoever is in ſin, is ſin.</note> it peirceth and wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelf into every corner and chinck, and ſo doth ſin winde it ſelf into our thoughts, words, and works; it will winde it ſelf into our underſtandings, to darken them; and into our judgements, to pervert them; and into our wills, to poiſon them; and into our affections, to diſorder them; and into our conſciences, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt them; and into our carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to debaſe them. Sin will winde it ſelf into every duty, and every mercy, it will winde it ſelf into every one of our enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and concernments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> having overcome the <hi>Romans,</hi> put on their armour
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:30758:163"/>on his ſhoulders, and ſo by that policy they being taken for <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> won a City; but what are <hi>Hannibals</hi> wiles, to ſins wiles, or Satans wiles? if you have a minde to bee acquainted with their wiles, look over my Treatiſe called <hi>Precious Remedies againſt Satans Devices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly and laſtly, Fire is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring, a conſuming Element,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 21.9.</note> it turns all fuel into aſhes; It is a Woolf that eats up all,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.5, 6. Pro. 6.32. Eccleſ. 9.18. Prov. 13.13. ch. 20.29.1. Pro. 11.3. ch. 15.25. ch. 21.7</note> ſo Sin is a fire that devours and conſumes all, it turned <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorah</hi> into aſhes, it hath deſtroyed the <hi>Caldaean, Perſian,</hi> and <hi>Graecian</hi> Kingdomes, and will at laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the <hi>Roman</hi> Kingdome alſo; this Woolf ate up <hi>Sampſons</hi> ſtrength, <hi>Abſoloms</hi> beauty, <hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophels</hi> policy, and <hi>Herods</hi> glory, &amp;c. It hath drowned one world already, and will at laſt burn another, even this. Oh the hopes, the hearts, the happineſſe, the joyes, the comforts, the ſouls that this fire (Sin) hath
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:30758:164"/>conſumed and deſtroyed! &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter Camois</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Betty</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> in his draught of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>Num.</hi> 75. tells us that ſome devout perſonages cauſed thoſe words of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (to bee written in letters of gold upon their chimny peeces) <hi>Who among us ſhall dwell with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring fire?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 33.14.</note> 
                  <hi>who among us ſhall dwell with everlaſting burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ah young men, young men! I deſire that you may alwaies look upon ſin under the notion of fire, yea as ſuch fire as laies the foundation for everlaſting fire, for everlaſting burnings, and this may work when other things will not.</p>
               <p>I have read of a grave and chaſte Matron, who being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to commit folly with a lew'd Ruſſian, after ſome diſcourſe, ſhee call'd for a pan of burning coals, requeſting him for her ſake to hold his finger in them but one hour, hee anſwered, it is
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:30758:164"/>an unkind requeſt, to whom ſhe replyed, that ſeeing hee would not do ſo much as to put one finger upon the coals for one hour, ſhe could not yeild to do that, for which ſhee ſhould bee tormented both body and ſoul in hell fire for ever. The application is eaſy, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If you would break with Sin betimes, if you would arm againſt Sin in the ſpring and morning of your dayes, then you ſhould look upon Sin under the notion of a Thief, and indeed Sin is the greateſt Theif, the greateſt Robber in the World, it robbed the Angels of all their glory,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2, 4 Gen. 3</note> it robbed <hi>Adam</hi> of his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, and felicity, and it hath robbed all the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> of five precious Jewels, the leaſt of which was more worth than hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth.</p>
               <p n="1">1 It hath robbed them of the holy and glorious Image of God, which would have been fairly engraven upon them, had

               <p n="4">4 It hath robbed them of their communion and fellowſhip with Father, Son, and Spirit, and made them Strangers and Aliens.</p>
               <p n="5">5 It hath robbed them of their glory, and made them vile and miſerable. It hath rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed many a nation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and many a pariſh of many a happy guide; and many a Chriſtian of the favour of God, the joyes of the ſpirit, and the Peace of Conſcience.</p>
               <p>Oh the health, the wealth, the honor, the friends, the relations, that Sin hath robbed thouſands of.</p>
               <p>Nay, It hath robbed many of their gifts, their arts, their parts, their memory, their judgement;
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:30758:165"/>yea their very reaſon, as you may ſee in <hi>Pharoah, Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar, Belſhazzar, Achitophel, Haman, Herod,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſh</hi> Princes that accuſed <hi>Daniel.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Menipus</hi> of <hi>Phenicia,</hi> who having loſt his goods, ſtrangled himſelf. And ſo <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narcus Phidon</hi> at a certain loſſe; cut his own throat to ſave the charge of a cord. And ſo <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus Caeſar</hi> (in whoſe time Chriſt was born) was ſo troubled and aſtoniſhed at the relation of an overthrow from <hi>Varrus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Suetonius.</note> that for certain months together, he let the hair of his beard and head grow ſtill, and wore it long; yea and other whiles would run his head againſt the doors, crying out <hi>Quintilius Varrus,</hi> deliver up my Legions again; by all which, it is moſt apparent, that Sin is the greateſt thief in all the World. Oh then who would not break league and covenant with it, and be ſtill in preſſing of God, to do juſtice upon it? &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="292" facs="tcp:30758:166"/>
               <p>Fifthly,
<note place="margin">Nah. 1.1 Hab. 1.1 Mal. 11</note> If you would break with Sin, and arm and fence your ſelves againſt Sin betimes, then you muſt look upon ſinne under the notion of a burden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; and indeed ſin of all bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens is the heavieſt burden in all the world. Innumerable evils have compaſſed me about,
<note place="margin">Pſal 40.12</note> mine iniquities have taken hold upon mee; ſo that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of my head, therefore my heart faileth me; and again, <hi>Mine iniquities are gone over my head</hi> (ſaith the ſame perſon) as an heavy burden,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 38.4</note> they are too hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy for mee to bear. Sin is a weight that eaſily beſets poor ſouls,
<note place="margin">Heb. 12.1</note> it is a burden that ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles them, and puzzles them, that ſo curbs them, and girds them,
<note place="margin">Rom. 7.13. ult.</note> that ſo preſſes and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes them, as that it wrings many bitter tears from their eyes, and many ſad and grievous ſighs and groans from their hearts.</p>
               <p>Again, As Sin is a burden to
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:30758:166"/>Chriſtians, ſo it is a burden to heaven,
<note place="margin">Jud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">Numb. 16.26.35.</note> as Sin is a burden to Heaven, ſo it is a burden to the earth, witneſs her ſwallowing up, <hi>Korah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> their Wives, children, Goods, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, &amp;c. Ah! Sinners your ſins makes the very earth to groan; they make the earth weary of bearing you. Oh! How doth the earth groan and long to ſwallow up thoſe earthly wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, whoſe hopes, whoſe hearts are buried in the earth, theſe ſhall have little of heaven, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of earth when they come to dye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cornelius Alapide,</hi> tells a ſtory, that he heard of a famous Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.19, 20, 21, 22, 23</note> who ſhewing the bondage of the Creature, brings in the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:30758:167"/>Creature complaining thus; Oh! that wee could ſerve ſuch as are Godly; Oh! that our ſubſtance and our fleſh, might bee incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into godly people, that ſo wee might riſe into glory with them; Oh! that our fleſh might not bee incorporated into the fleſh of ſinners, for if it bee, we ſhall go to hell, and would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny creatures go to hell? Oh! we are weary of bearing ſinners, wee are weary of ſerving of ſinners; thus the creatures groan, thus the creatures complain, the Sinners ſins forcing them to it, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Again, Sin is a burden to God, <hi>Behold I am preſſed under you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Amos. 2.13</note> 
                  <hi>as a cart is preſſed that is full of ſhcaves,</hi> by this plain pithy countrey compariſon, God ſhews how ſadly hee is preſſed and oppreſſed, how ſorely hee is wearied and tired with thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Sins; Divine patience is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven worn out; Juſtice hath lift up her hand, and will bear with them no longer. God ſeems to
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:30758:167"/>groan under the preſſure of their Sinnes, as a Cart ſeems to do under a heavy load; of this God complains by the Prophet <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iah,</hi>

                  <hi>Thou haſt made me to ſerve with thy ſins, thou haſt wearied mee with thine iniquities.</hi> I am as weary of your Sins, as a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling woman is weary of her pains, ſaith God. Sin was ſuch a burden to God, that he ſweeps it off with a ſweeping Floud, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">Luk. 22.44 A ſtrange wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of a garden. Bern. 1 Pet. 2.24</note> Sin is a burden to Chriſt, it made him ſweat, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver man ſweat; it made him ſweat great drops of clotted or congealed bloud; Sin put Chriſts whole body into a bloudy ſweat, it made him groan pittiouſly when he bare our Sins in his body on the Tree. Sin made his ſoul heavy even to the death, and had he not been one that was mighty,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 6.6</note> yea, that was all-mighty, he had fainted and failed under his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. And thus you ſee what a burthen Sin is, to man, to
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:30758:168"/>the Creatures, to heaven, to earth, to God, to Chriſt; and therefore as you would break with Sin betimes, look alwayes upon it as a burden, yea, as the greateſt and heavieſt burden in all the world, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Sixthly and Laſtly, If you would break Covenant with Sin, and arm, and fence your ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it betimes, then you muſt look upon it betimes under the notion of a Tyrant,
<note place="margin">Tit. 3.3</note> and indeed Sin is the worſt and greateſt Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the world. Other Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants can but Tyranize over our bodies, but Sin is a Tyrant that tyranizes over both body and ſoul, as you may ſee in the ſixth and ſeventh of the <hi>Romans,</hi> Sin is a Tyrant that hath a kinde of juriſdiction in moſt mens hearts; it ſets up the Law of Pride, the Law of Paſſion, the Law of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, the Law of Formality, the Law of Hypocriſy, the Law of Carnality, the Law of Self-love, the Law of Carnal-Reaſon,

               <p>Sin is a Tyrant of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years ſtanding,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Thales</hi> one of the ſeven Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, uſed to ſay that few Tyrants lived to be old; but it is far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with this Tyrant Sin.

O! the hearts that this Tyrant makes to ake, the ſouls that this Tyrant makes to bleed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pharoahs</hi> Tyranny was nothing to Sins Tyranny, this Tyrant will not ſo much as ſuffer his ſlaves to ſleep.

               <head>The Young mans objections Anſwered</head>
               <p>I ſhall now give ſome brief Anſwers to the Young mans Objections, and the Old mans ſcruples, and ſo cloſe up this diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But ſome young men may object and ſay; you would have us to bee good betimes, and to ſeek and ſerve the Lord in the Prime-roſe of our dayes, but it may be time enough hereafter to
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:30758:170"/>follow this Counſel; wee are young, and it may bee time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for us to minde theſe things hereafter, when wee have ſatisfied the fleſh ſo and ſo, or when wee have got enough of the world, and laid up ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that will ſtand us inſtead, and that may oil our joynts when wee are old. Now</p>
               <p>To this Objection I anſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That it is the greateſt folly and madneſſe in the world to put off God, and the great things of eternity with may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees, what Trades-man, what Merchant, what Marriner ſo mad, ſo fooliſh, ſo blockiſh, as to put off a preſent ſeaſon, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent opportunity of profit and advantage upon the account of a may-bee? It may bee I may have as good a ſeaſon, it may bee I ſhall have as golden an opportunity to get, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich my ſelf as this is; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore farewell to this. No men that are in their right minds will
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:30758:170"/>argue thus; and why then ſhould you eſpecially in the things that are of an everlaſting concernment to you?</p>
               <p>I have read of one <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> a frantick <hi>Italian,</hi> who thought that all the Kings of the Earth were his Vaſſals, and as frantick are they, who wilfully neglect preſent ſeaſons of grace, upon the account of a future may-bee, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwer, it may bee if thou neglecteſt this preſent ſeaſon, and opportunity of grace, thou mayeſt never have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<note place="margin">Young men, if you will but go into burial pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, you ſhall finde graves exactly of your length.</note> it may bee mercy may never knock more, if thou doſt not now open; it may bee Chriſt ſhall never bee offered to thee more, if now thou doſt not cloſe with him, and accept of him; it may bee the Spirit will never ſtrive more with thee, if now thou doſt reſiſt him, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him; it may bee a pardon ſhall never bee offered to thee more, if now thou wilt not take
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:30758:171"/>it; it may bee the Goſpel ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſound more in thy ears, if now thou wilt not hear it; now ſet one may-bee againſt another may-bee, ſet Gods may-bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thine own may-bee, but</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Doubtleſſe there are many thouſand thouſands now in Hell, who have pleaſed themſelves, and put off God, and the ſeaſons of grace with a may-bee, hereafter may bee time enough. It may bee when I have gratified ſuch a luſt,
<note place="margin">It was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to King <hi>Lyſamachus,</hi> that his ſtaying to drink one draught of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter loſt him his Kingdome.</note> and when I have treaſured up ſo much of the world, I will return and ſeek, and ſerve the Lord, but before ever this ſeaſon or opportunity came, juſtice hath cut the threed of their lives, and they are now miſerable for ever; and now they are ſtill a curſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, becauſe they have ſlipt their golden opportunities upon the account of a may-bee, &amp;c. But</p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly, This put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off of God, and the preſent
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:30758:171"/>ſeaſons of grace with a may-bee, is very provoking to God, as you may ſee if you will but read from the 20. <hi>verſe</hi> to the 33. of the firſt of <hi>Proverbs.</hi> Nothing ſtirs and provokes a Maſter more, than his ſervants putting off his ſervice, or his commands with a may-bee; it may bee I will, it may bee I may do this and that, nothing puts a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſooner into a heat, a flame, than this; nor nothing puts God more into a flame than this, as you may ſee by comparing <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. <hi>ver.</hi> 6. to the end; with that 3. of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> and the 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. read the words, and tremble at the thought of a may-bee, at the thoughts of putting off of God, and the ſeaſons of grace.</p>
               <p>I have read of two, who cut off their right hand one for another, and then made it an excuſe, a put off, they were lame, and ſo could not ſerve in the Gallies of <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, King of <hi>France,</hi>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:30758:172"/>but this practiſe of theirs did ſo inſenſe and provoke the King, that hee ſent them both to the Gallows. I ſuppoſe the reader is not ſo young, but knows how to apply it.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>If I ſhould begin to bee good betimes, and to ſeek and ſerve the Lord in the ſpring and morning of my daies, I ſhould loſe my friends, I ſhould loſe their favour, for they are carnal and worldly, and had rather I ſhould ſeek after gold, than God, the Creature, than Chriſt, Earth, than Heaven, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to this I anſwer, Surely you are out, for</p>
               <p>Firſt, This is the high way, the ready way to gain the beſt, the ſureſt, and the ſoundeſt friends.

Twelfthly, An univerſal friend, a friend in all caſes, and a friend in all places.

<note place="margin">Luk. 1.43 John 20.28 Phil. 4.19</note> Chriſt is ſuch an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal friend, as that he ſupplies the place, and acts the part of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very friend.</p>

                  <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> would not ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly entertain a league of friendſhip with any, but was a

               <p>Ah!

               <p>Secondly, Thou were't bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be without their friendſhip and favour, than to enjoy it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any ſinful and unworthy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, thou were't better run the hazard of looſing thy friends, and their favour, by ſeeking and

               <p>Sixthly, I Anſwer, <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced more in his ſuffering re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches for Chriſts ſake, than he did in his being wrapt up in the third heaven, 2 Cor. 12.10. <hi>Therefore I take pleaſure in infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,</hi>

But</p>
               <p>Seventhly, I Anſwer,
<note place="margin">It was an Ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſervation of Mr. <hi>John Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay,</hi> that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmoak of Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> converted as many as it blew upon.</note> That by a wiſe and gracious behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our under the reproaches thou meeteſt with for Chriſts ſake, thou maieſt be inſtrumentall to win others to Chriſt.

               <p>Divers have been won to Chriſt by beholding the gracious carriages of Chriſtians under their ſufferings, and reproaches for Chriſt.</p>

               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:30758:182"/>
               <p>When one came and Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched <hi>Xenophon,</hi> ſayes hee, you have learned how to reproach, and I have learned how to bear Reproach.</p>

               <p>When one wondered at the patience of <hi>Socrates</hi> towards one who reviled and reproached him; if we ſhould meet one ſaith hee, whoſe body were more unſound then ours, ſhould we be angry with him, and not rather pitty him? why then ſhould we

               <p>It is a notable example that wee finde of one <hi>Pericles,</hi>

Ah young men, young men ſhall the very Heathen make nothing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, ſhall they bear up ſo prudently and bravely under the greateſt loads of reproaches, and will not you? will not you? who in your light, in your mercies, and in all Goſpel engagements, are ſo highly advanced above them?

It is ſaid of <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> the King of <hi>Iſrael, that hee did evil in the ſight of the Lord, as his Fathers had done; hee departed not from the ſins of Jeroboam,</hi> hee would bee as his Father was, and do as his Father did, whatever

Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is not apter to take fire, nor Wax the impreſſion of the ſeal, nor Paper the ink, than youth is to follow ill examples. You may ſee in <hi>Radbod,</hi> King of <hi>Phriſia,</hi> who coming to the Font to bee baptiſed, asked what was

               <p>I remember the Heathen brings in a young man, who hearing of the adulteries, and wickedneſſes of the gods, ſaid, what,

Sinful examples are very drawing, and very incouraging, many have found it ſo to their eternal undoing; thoſe that have no ears to hear what you ſay, have many eyes to ſee what you do. Bad Princes make bad Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, bad Maſters make bad Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, bad Parents make bad Children, and bad Husbands make bad Wives; it is eaſier for the bad to corrupt the good, than for the good to convert the bad; it is eaſier to rundown the hill with company, than to run up the hill alone.</p>
               <p>I would deſire all young men

Young men, in theſe profeſſing times, ſtand between good and bad examples, as <hi>Hercules</hi> in his dream ſtood between vertue and vice. Solicited by both, chuſe you muſt who to follow. Oh that you were all ſo wiſe as to follow the beſt; as a woman that hath many ſutors is very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to take the beſt; ſo ſhould you, life, Heaven, happineſſe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity hangs upon it.</p>
               <p>But before I come to the ſecond anſwer,
<note place="margin">Sin is bad in the eye, worſer in the tongue, worſer in the heart, but worſt of all in the life; and that becauſe it then indangers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens ſouls, as well as a mans own.</note> let mee leave this note or notion with thoſe who make no conſcience of undoing others by their examples, <hi>viz.</hi> That a more grievous puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is reſerved for them who cauſe others to offend, than for them which ſin by their occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or example.

But</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I anſwer, you muſt not live by examples, but by precepts; you are not to look ſo much at what others do,

Great perſonages urged it, and it was at the Kings banquet where they judged of loyalty by luxury, and put us upon this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, drink, or die, the not drinking of a health had been our death; hee gives this anſwer, that God who ſees that for love to him, and his commands, thou wouldeſt not conform to their drunken cuſtomes, will give thee favour in their eyes, who thus threatneth thee to drink.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, I anſwer, company and allurements to ſin, will bee found no ſufficient excuſe for ſin. If <hi>Eve</hi> lay her fault on the Serpent,

               <p>Fifthly and laſtly,
<note place="margin">Mat. 18.7.</note> I anſwer, that it is a very great judgement to bee given up to follow evil examples: a man given up to evil examples, is a man ſadly left of God, wofully blinded by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and deſperately hardened in ſin; it ſpeaks a man ripe for wrath, for ruine, for hell, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.21.

                  <hi>Behold, I will lay ſtumbling blocks before this people, and the Fathers and the Sons together ſhall fall upon them; the neighbour and his friend ſhall periſh.</hi> Oh! it is a dreadful thing when God ſhall make the ſinful examples of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to bee ſtumbling blocks to a people, at which they ſhall ſtumble, and fall, and periſh for ever; good had it been for ſuch perſons, that they had never been born, as Chriſt once ſpake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Judas.</hi> The <hi>Rhodians</hi> and <hi>Lydians</hi> enacted ſeveral Laws, that thoſe ſons which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed not their Fathers in their vertues,

               <p>The fifth and laſt Objection (I ſhall mention) is this, <hi>God is a God of mercy, in him are bowels of mercy; yea a Sea, an Ocean of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; hee loves mercy, hee delights in mercy, and hee is ready to ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to poor ſinners, when they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at the laſt caſt, when there is but a ſhort ſtride between them and the grave, between them and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi> as wee ſee in his extending mercy to the Theef, and in his giving a pardon into his hand, and the aſſurance of Paradiſe into his boſome, when hee was ready to be turned off the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of life; and therefore I may ſpend the Prim-roſe of my daies in following ſin, and the delights,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:30758:190"/>profits, vanities, and contents of this world, and at laſt caſt, I may have mercy as well as the Theef. God is a God made up of mercy, and ſurely hee will not deny ſome crums of mercy to a poor ſinner in miſery, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now to this Objection I ſhall give theſe following anſwers.</p>
               <p>Firſt, God is as juſt as hee is merciful, witneſſe his caſting the Angels out of Heaven, and <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe,
<note place="margin">God is as well all hand to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, as hee is all grace to pardon.</note> witneſſe all the threatnings, the curſes, the woes, that the Bible is filled with, from one end, to the other; witneſſe the hell, the horrour, the terrour and amazement that hee raiſes in the conſciences of ſinners; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the devaſtations that hee hath made of the moſt ſtately flouriſhing Towns, Cities, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Kingdomes, that have been in all the world; witneſſe the variety of diſeaſes, calamities, miſeries, dangers, deaths, and hells, that alwaies attends the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the world; but above
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:30758:190"/>all witneſs Chriſts treading the Wine-preſs of his fathers wrath; witneſs his hiding his face from him, and the pouring out of all his diſpleaſure, and vengeance upon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zaleucus</hi> the <hi>Locrenſian</hi> Lawgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<note place="margin">Valerius lib. 6. cap. 5</note> thruſt out one of his own ſons eyes, for his tranſgreſſing of a wholeſome Law, which hee had enacted, but God the father thruſt out both Chriſts eys for our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing of his royal Law; Oh! the juſtice &amp; ſeverity of God. But</p>
               <p>Secondly, I Anſwer, that there is not a greater evidence of blindneſs, prophaneneſſe, hard-heartedneſs, ſpiritual madneſs, and helliſh deſperateneſs in all the World, than to make that an Argument, an incouragement, to ſin (viz. the mercy of God) which ſhould be the greateſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument under heaven, to keep a man from Sin, as all know that have but read the ſcripture; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are there any Sinners in the World, that God delights to
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:30758:191"/>rain Hell out of Heaven upon,
<note place="margin">Read Iſa. 22 12, 13, 14, 15 and Ezek. 24.11, 12, 13, 14</note> as upon ſuch, who by their abuſe of mercy, turns the God of mercy, into a God of cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ts, and goes on out-daring juſtice it ſelf, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19, 20. <hi>And it come to paſs, when he heareth the words of this curſe, that he bleſs himſelf in his heart, ſaying,</hi> I <hi>ſhall have Peace (God is a God of mercy) though I walk in the imagination of my heart, to adde drunkenneſs to thirſt:</hi> The Lord will not ſpare him, but then the Anger of the Lord, and his jealouſy, ſhall ſmoak againſt that man, and all the Curſes that are written in this book ſhall lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and the Lord ſhall blot out his name from under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. In theſe words you may obſerve, that God is abſolute in threatning, to ſhew that he will bee reſolute in puniſhing, Pſal. 11.5,
<note place="margin">A lover of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity is a liver in Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity upon choice.</note> 6. <hi>The wicked, and him that loveth iniquity; doth his ſoul hate. Upon the wicked he ſhall rain ſnares, fire and brimſtone, and an horrible tempeſt, this ſhall be the portion of their cup.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="343" facs="tcp:30758:191"/>
               <p>Ah! That all poor ſinners would make theſe two Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures their companions, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant bed-fellows, till they are got above that ſad temptation of turning the mercy of God into an incouragement to ſin.</p>
               <p>Whilſt <hi>Milo Crotoniates</hi> was tearing a ſunder the ſtock of an Oake, his ſtrength failing him, the clift ſuddenly cloſing, was held ſo faſt by the hands, that he became a prey to the beaſts of the field; All the abuſers of mercy will certainly, and ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, become a prey to the juſtice of God, that will rent and tear them in peices as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, Pſal. 50.22. <hi>Wo, wo, to that ſoul that fights againſt God with his own mercies,</hi> that will bee bad, becauſe hee is good; that will be ſinful, becauſe he is merciful; that will turn all the kindneſſes of God (that ſhould bee as ſo many ſilver cords, to tye him to love and obedience) into arrows, and ſo ſhoot them back into the
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:30758:192"/>heart of God. Abuſed mercy will at laſt turn into a Lyon, a fierce Lyon; and then wo to the abuſers and deſpiſers of it. But</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In Anſwer, to that part of the Objection, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Thief on the Croſs, I offer theſe things briefly to your thoughts.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">Exemplum la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronis ſervati eſt admirandum, non imitandum</note> That as one was ſaved to teach Sinners, not to deſpair, ſo another was damned to teach them not to preſume. A pardon is ſometimes given to one upon the Gallows, but who ſo truſts to that, the rope may be his hire, it is not good (ſaith one) to put it upon the Pſalm of <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerere,</hi> and the neck verſe; for ſometimes hee proves no Clerk, and ſo hangs for it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is an example without a promiſe, here is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of late repentance, but where is there a promiſe of late repentance.</p>
               <p>Oh! Let not his late and ſudden converſion, be to thee a
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:30758:192"/>temptation, till thou haſt found a promiſe for late and ſudden converſion; it is not examples, but promiſes that are foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for faith to reſt on; he that walks by an example of mercy, without a precept to guide him, and a promiſe to ſupport him, walks but by a dark Lanthorn, that will deceive him: well young man remember this, examples of mercy increaſe wrath, when the heart is not bettered by them; But</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This was a rare mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of mercy, with the glory wherof Chriſt did honour the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy of his Croſs, and therfore wee may as well look for another crucifying of Chriſt, as look for a ſinners converſion, when he hath ſcarce time enough to reckon up, all thoſe particular duties, which make up the integrity of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. But</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I Anſwer, This Theif knew not Chriſt before, he had not refuſed, neglected, nor
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:30758:193"/>ſlighted Chriſt before; the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on the Croſs was the firſt Sermon that ever he heard Chriſt preach, and Chriſts prayer on the Croſs, was the firſt prayer that ever he heard Chriſt make; he knew not Chriſt till hee met him on the Croſs (which proved to him a happy meeting) his caſe was as if a Turk, or Heathen, ſhould now be converted to the faith, and therefore thou haſt lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reaſon; O young man, to plead this example to keep Chriſt, and thy ſoul aſunder, who art every day under the call, the intreaties and wooings of Chriſt. But</p>
               <p>Fifthly, and Laſtly, I Anſwer, The circumſtances of time, and place, are rightly to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Now when Chriſt was triumphing on the Croſs over ſin, ſatan, and the world, when he had made the devils a publik ſpectacle of ſcorn and deriſion, when hee was taking his leave of the world, and entering into his glory; Now hee puts a pardon into the Theifs
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:30758:193"/>hand, and crouds other favours and kindneſſes upon him.</p>
               <p>As in the <hi>Roman</hi> Triumphs, the Victor being aſcended up to the Capitol in a Chariot of ſtate, uſed to caſt certain peeces of coyn among the people for them to pick up, which hee uſed not to do at other times; So our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in the day of his Triumph, and ſolemn inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration into his heavenly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſcatters ſome heavenly jewels that this Theif might pick up; which he doth not, nor will not do every day; Or as in theſe days it is uſual with Princes to ſave ſome notorious malefactors at their coronation, when they enter upon their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes in Triumph, which they do not uſe to do afterwards; So did Jeſus Chriſt carry it toward this Thief; but this is not his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way of ſaving and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſouls to glory, and therefore do not O young man, let not the Thiefs late converſion, prove
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:30758:194"/>a temptation, or an occaſion of thy delaying thy repentance, and trifling away the primeroſe of thy dayes in vanity and folly; And thus much may ſuffice to have ſpoken, by way of Anſwer, to the Young mans Objections.</p>

               <p>Is it ſo commendable, ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, and ſo neceſſary for young men to be good betimes, to ſeek and ſerve the Lord in the ſpring and morning of their Youth, as hath been ſufficiently demonſtrated in this Treatiſe?

               <p>I but aged Sinners may reply, is there any hope, any help for us? is there any probability, is there any poſſibility? that ever ſuch as we are ſhould return and finde mercy and favour with the Lord? wee who have lived ſo long without him, we that have ſinned ſo much againſt him, we that to this day are ſtrangers to him, yea in arms againſt him; Is there any hope that we white-headed ſinners, who have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſo many thouſand offers of grace, and ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand motions of the ſpirit, and ſo many thouſand checks of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and ſo many thouſand tenders of Chriſt, and heaven, that ever we ſhould obtain mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that ever we ſhould have our old hearts turned, our mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Sin pardoned, our vile
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:30758:195"/>natures changed, and poor ſouls ſaved, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, that there is hope even for ſuch as you are; all the Angels in heaven, and all the men on earth, cannot tell, but that you, even you, may obtain mercy and favour, that your ſouls dye not; with the Lord nothing is impoſſible, and for the grace of the Goſpel, nothing is too hard; now this I ſhall make evident by an induction of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, thus</p>

               <p>Fourthly, The Lord hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by Oath, a greater delight in the converſion and ſalvation of poor ſinners (whether they are young or old) than in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and damnation of ſuch, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. <hi>As I live ſaith the Lord God, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live:</hi> Turn ye, turn ye, from your evil wayes? for why will ye dye, O ye houſe of Iſraell; two things make a thing more credible.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The quality or dignity of the perſon ſpeaking.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The manner of the ſpeech; Now here you have the great God, not onely ſpeaking, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, but ſolemnly ſwearing, that hee had rather poor ſinners ſhould live than dye, bee happy, than miſerable; therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair not, Oh aged ſinner, but

               <p>Fifthly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vna guttula plus valet, quam cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum &amp; terra. Luther.</hi> One little drop is more worth than heaven and earth.</note> there is vertue enough in the precious blood of Jeſus Chriſt to waſh and cleanſe away all ſin; not only to cleanſe away the young mans ſins, but alſo to cleanſe away the old mans ſins; not only to cleanſe a ſinner of twenty years old, but to cleanſe a ſinner of fifty, ſixty, yea a hundred years old, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. <hi>The blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all ſin;</hi> not ſimply from ſin, but from all ſin; there is ſuch a power and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in the blood of Chriſt, as is ſufficient to cleanſe all ſorts of ſinners, from all ſorts of ſins; there is vertue in the blood of the Lamb to waſh out all the ſpots that are in the oldeſt ſinners heart; and therefore let not old ſinners deſpair, let not them ſay, there is no hope, there is no help, as long as this fountain the blood of Jeſus Chriſt is open, for all ſorts of ſinners to waſh in. But</p>
               <pb n="345" facs="tcp:30758:198"/>
               <p>Sixthly, The call and invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chriſt in the Goſpel, are general, and indefinite, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no ſort of ſinners, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20 <hi>Behold, I ſtand at the door, and knock; if any man</hi> (mark the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteneſſe of perſonal admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) <hi>hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will ſup with him, and hee with mee;</hi> let the ſinner bee old or young, a green head, or a gray head, if hee will but open the door, Chriſt will come in, and have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and fellowſhip with him. So in that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>John</hi> 7.37. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. turn to theſe Scriptures, and dwell upon them, they all clearly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the call and gracious invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Chriſt to bee to all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to every ſinner, hee excepts not a man, no, though never ſo old, nothing ſhall hinder the ſinner, any ſinner, the worſt and moſt aged ſinner, from obtaining mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, if hee bee willing to open to Chriſt, and to receive him as
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:30758:199"/>his Lord and King, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. But</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Chriſts patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal lamentation over all ſorts and ranks of ſinners, declares his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe to ſhew mercy to them, <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem</hi> (ſaith Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Luk. 19.41, 42.</note> weaping over it) <hi>that thou hadſt known in this thy day the things that belong to thy peace,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 81.13.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c. O that my people had hearkened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee!</hi> Chriſt weeps over <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi> ſo did <hi>Titus,</hi> and ſo did <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> over <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> and ſo did <hi>Scipio</hi> over <hi>Carthage;</hi> but they ſhed tears for them, whoſe blood they were to ſhed; but Chriſt weeps over the necks of thoſe young and old ſinners, who were to ſhed his blood. As a tender hearted Father weeps over his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Children, when neither ſmiles, nor frowns, neither coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, nor intreaties will win them, or turn them from their evil waies. So doth Jeſus Chriſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver theſe rebellious Jews upon whom nothing would work; But</p>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:30758:199"/>
               <p>Eighthly and laſtly, though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſinners have given Chriſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand denyals, yet he hath not taken them, but after all,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 65.1, 2. Rom. 10.21.</note> and in the face of all denyals, hee ſtill re-inforces his ſuit, and continues to beſeech them by his Spirit,
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.2, 3.</note> by his word, by his wounds, by his blood, by his meſſengers, and by his rebukes, to turn home to him to embrace him, to beleeve in him, and to match with him, that they may bee ſaved eternally by him; all which beſpeaks gray-headed ſinners, not to deſpair, nor to diſpute, but to repent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and beleeve that it may go well with them for ever. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſeriouſly what hath been ſpoken and the Lord make you wiſe for eternity.</p>
